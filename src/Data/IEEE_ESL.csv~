"A circuit-centric approach to electronic system-level diagnostics and prognostics","Sai Sarathi Vasan, A.; Chen, C.; Pecht, M.","Dept. of Mech.

In these applications, incorporating prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques provide systems with capabilities to self assess performance, determine the advent of failure and mitigate system risks. However, the prognostics problem for electronic systems is still approached from a component-centric-view. Extending a component-centric approach to an electronic system becomes complex and is often not worth the cost of pursuit due to the imbalance between scalability and efficiency of the prognostics approach. In order to address this problem, we propose a circuit-centric approach as an alternative method for realizing prognostics at an electronic system-level. The proposed approach is developed from the idea of decomposing a system into multiple critical circuits, and exploiting the parameters specific to the system's circuitries for predicting failure. Furthermore, a method is developed for detecting the gradual degradation of an electronic system by defining a health indicator to represent the system's health state at any given time. In this paper, we provide a formulation of the electronic system-level prognostics problem and demonstrate the approach on an electronic system for filtering analog signals.","","978-1-4673-5722-7","","10.1109/ICPHM.2013.6621432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621432","circuit failure prediction;circuit-centric apporach;electronic system prognostics","Band-pass filters;Circuit faults;Degradation;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Prognostics and health management;Testing","analogue circuits;failure analysis;network analysis;signal processing","analog signal filtering;circuit-centric approach;component-centric approach;electronic system- level prognostics;electronic system-level diagnostics;failure;health indicator;health state;multiple critical circuits","","","","0","","","","","20131007","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This design methodology is commonly referred to Electronic System Level (ESL) design. Simultaneously, dependability of embedded systems becomes a major concern. To satisfy these demands already at ESL, we present a dependability analysis approach working directly at this level. The approach analyzes the effectiveness of dependability measures in SystemC-based virtual prototypes. Errors are injected into SystemC transactions using an XML-based configuration mechanism. This is combined with the specification of the expected behavior with respect to the injected errors. The developed analysis approach allows for validation of dependability measures as well as localization of missing or buggy measures.

To simplify the use of the proposed virtual platform, we define some specific APIs for data transaction and developers can simply follow the pre-defined protocol and complete the data transaction. We also implement the TLM interface for external modules to communicate with the host virtual platform. Furthermore, the proposed virtual platform is capable of running multiple applications with dynamic loading of application programs in run time. That means the multiple applications could execute sequentially without pre-loading all programs when initialized. The virtual platform with 4 SPARC cores can execute up to 1605.88K cycles per second on a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo machine.

The starting point was the Softfloat ANSI-C implementation of the standard. Minimal modifications, in the form of two parallel processes, were introduced to map the ANSI-C code to the Input/Output interface of a cardbus-based field-programmable gate array prototyping board. The remaining part of the code was directly synthesized to gates using Cebatech's C2R compiler and a number of configurations were studied with various degrees of functional-unit sharing and capabilities. Preliminary results clearly identify the potential of next generation ESL tools in transforming control-oriented applications written in ANSI-C code directly to synthesizable verilog, in record time. At the same time, the generated silicon exhibits up to two orders of magnitude better cycle performance compared to the Softfloat standard executing on an in-order superscalar processor (simulated) thus making a strong statement for the suitability of the ESL tool for the silicon synthesis of control-dominated applications. The design was validated both at the C-level as well as on an E14 PicoComputing FPGA board were it achieved an operating frequency of 64 MHz.","","978-1-4244-1516-8","978-1-4244-1517-5","10.1109/NORCHP.2007.4481066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4481066","","ANSI standards;Design methodology;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Hardware;Microarchitecture;Prototypes;Silicon;Very large scale integration","ANSI standards;IEEE standards;field programmable gate arrays;floating point arithmetic;system buses","ANSI-C code;Cebatech C2R compiler;E14 PicoComputing FPGA board;IEEE 754 floating point engine;IEEE 754-compliant pipelined floating point engine;Softfloat ANSI-C implementation;Softfloat standard;cardbus;coarse-level pipelined floating point engine;control-dominated applications;electronic system level tool;field-programmable gate array prototyping board;functional-unit sharing;input/output interface;parallel processes;silicon synthesis;single-precision pipelined floating point engine;superscalar processor","","","","0","","17","","","20080404","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To efficiently map software applications to such architectures, the impact of platform decisions with respect to the hardware and the software infrastructure (OS, scheduling policies, priorities, mapping) has to be explored in early design phases. In this work, we discuss the challenges of the multi- and many-core design-space. We give an overview of our existing SystemC™-based OSSS design flow including software multitasking in system-level models. We propose extensions towards multi- and many-core platform models and discuss which aspects of the system behaviour can be captured.

In abstractions like the Register Transfer Level (RTL) or the gate level, cone of influence analysis is simple. However, the introduction of higher levels of abstractions, particularly the Electronic System Level (ESL), made it significantly harder to reliably extract a cone of influence. In this paper, we propose a methodology that enables cone of influence analysis at the ESL. Instead of a structural analysis, a behavioral scheme is proposed, i.e. stimuli representing different system executions are analyzed. To this end, machine learning techniques are exploited. This enables a very good approximation of the desired cone of influence which is non-invasive, does not rely on the availability of the source code, and performs fast. Case studies confirm the applicability of the proposed approach.","","","","10.1109/DSD.2013.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6628330","Cone of Influence;ESL;Machine Learning;SystemC","Approximation methods;Availability;Decision trees;Entropy;Libraries;Logic gates;Machine learning algorithms","electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);logic gates","ESL;RTL;behavioral scheme;circuit signal;cone-of-influence analysis;design tasks;electronic system level;gate level;machine learning;noninvasive cone-of-influence approximation;register transfer level;source code;system executions","","","","0","","","","","20131015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SoCs are increasingly complex and heterogeneous systems that are highly integrated comprising processors, caches, hardware accelerators, memories, peripherals and interconnects. Modern SoCs deploy not only simple buses but also crossbars and Networks-on-Chip (NoC) to connect dozens or even hundreds of modules. However, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these interconnects because of their complexity. This is a potential design risk. In order to address this challenge, early design space exploration is required to find appropriate system architectures out of many candidate architectures. An appropriate interconnect architecture is a fundamental outcome of these evaluations since its latency and throughput characteristics affect the performance of all attached modules in the SoC. In this paper we show how to perform early design space exploration using our Electronic System Level (ESL) performance evaluation framework SystemQ. We use a heterogeneous MultiProcessor SoC that features a complex NoC as a central interconnect. Based on this example we show the importance of proper abstraction in order to keep simulation efforts manageable.","1092-3152","978-1-4244-8193-4","","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5654090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654090","","Accuracy;Performance evaluation;Program processors;Space exploration;System-on-a-chip;Throughput;Topology","integrated circuit design;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","MPSoC;design space exploration;electronic system level;networks-on-chip;performance evaluation;system-on-chip","","","","1","","9","","","20101203","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the transaction-level model (TLM) can satisfy the requests on complex design with relative high simulation speed and well performance evaluation. In this paper, we implement a TLM-based network-on-chip (NoC) platform and share-bus system architecture with SystemC.

Out platform is able to evaluate performance in relatively short time, obtain important information and complete the design more instinctively.

The computation of between-class variance in Otsu's algorithm requires the evaluation of a normalized cumulative histogram, mean and cumulative moments, which need single-cycle read-modify-write operations. These operations are achieved by incorporating the FPGA's slices, dual-port Block RAM memories and DSP slices with DDR2 SDRAM as a frame buffer.

Native co-simulation has been proposed as a fast solution for evaluating systems in early design steps. Annotated SW execution can be performed in conjunction with a virtual model of the HW platform to generate a complete system simulation. To obtain sufficiently accurate performance estimations, the effect of all the system components, as processor caches, must be considered. ISS-based cache models slow down the simulation speed, greatly reducing the efficiency of native-based co-simulations. To solve the problem, cache modeling techniques for fast native co-simulation have been proposed, but only considering instruction-caches. In this paper, a fast technique for data-cache modeling is presented, together with the instrumentation required for its application in native execution. The model allows the designer to obtain cache hit/miss rate estimations with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude with respect to ISS. Miss rate estimation error remains below 5% for representative examples.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722227","Cache modelling;Electronic System Level;Embedded SW","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Data models;Embedded systems;Estimation;Memory management","cache storage;embedded systems;multiprocessing systems","complete system simulation;data-cache modeling;multiprocessor embedded systems;native co-simulation","","","","4","","25","","","20110303","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Productivity is enforced with HighLevel Synthesis (HLS) and Electronic System Level (ESL) design methodologies, that offer an efficient abstraction level to boost-up early prototyping. This paper presents a methodology and the required tool flow for the design of a System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, as a reference for modern control applications. The advantages of the proposed methodology are: (a) improved performance through hardware acceleration of demanding application cores, (b) improved quality of results with floating point calculations, (c) flexibility and integration of common peripheral devices supported by a RISC microcontroller and (d) improved designer productivity by avoiding Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and other time consuming and error introducing procedures and working with C level design descriptions only.

In Virtual Platform System (VPS), multi-level abstraction models should be properly adopted to achieve higher simulation performance while maintaining the platform design efforts as minimal as possible. For architecture validation, cycle-accurate system-level IP models are required to produce accurate performance simulation results. However, cycle-accurate model description often results in long modeling time and cycle inaccuracy due to complex timing behavior of given IPs. Therefore, RTL co-simulation has been widely used to avoid cycle-accurate model creation in system-level design process. In this paper, we suggest the Hybrid Virtual Platform System (H-VPS) to accelerate simulation speed by adopting co-emulation scheme into VPS while keeping cycle accuracy and minimizing risk of model creation. The experimental results of co-emulation show 12-48Kcps simulation speed, which is 6-62 times faster than VPS simulation time and is enough for architecture exploration and validation.","","978-1-4673-2989-7","978-1-4673-2988-0","10.1109/ISOCC.2012.6407126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407126","Electronic System Level(ESL);Transaction Level Modeling(TLM);Virtual Platform System(VPS);co-emulation","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Carbon;Computer architecture;Emulation","circuit simulation;electronic engineering computing;formal verification;hardware-software codesign;system-on-chip","ESL;H-VPS;RTL cosimulation;SoC design process;architectural performance analysis;architecture exploration;architecture validation;cycle-accurate system-level IP model;electronic system level;hardware-software codevelopment;hybrid virtual platform system;multilevel abstraction model;system-level simulation acceleration;system-on-chip","","","","0","","11","","","20130110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Raising the abstraction level leads to reduced complexity compared to classical RTL modeling; however, due to this lack of detail, verification of higher level models produces new problems. Assertion based verification (ABV) - a well established RTL methodology - is a good example of this. Temporal relations in RTL properties are specified in terms of clocks that trigger the design. It is not obvious how to specify properties for more abstract, non-clocked models where the notion of lime is annotated as estimated delay values or omitted completely. Since ABV has already shown to be a strong methodology for functional RTL verification, we expect the same benefit for TL by lifting current ABV approaches to a higher level. In this paper we present a prototypic formal framework for specifying TL properties. We focus our work on three TL model views, as defined in the OSCI TLM standard. For each view we describe the model of computation and derive the required operators. Furthermore, we explain the required execution semantics and give some application examples","","1-4244-0421-5","","10.1109/MEMCOD.2006.1695910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1695910","","Clocks;Computational modeling;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Hardware;Process design;Prototypes;Runtime;System-level design;Timing","formal verification;hardware-software codesign","abstraction level;assertion based verification;electronic system level;execution semantics;formal framework;hardware design;hardware verification;multiabstraction TLM assertions;temporal relations;transaction level properties specification","","","","4","","20","","","20060911","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aiming to bring a solution, several techniques have appeared as alternatives to verify that a circuit description meets the requirements of its corresponding functional specification. Simulation is widely applied due to its convenience to uncover early design bugs, but is far from providing the exhaustiveness acquired through formal methods, for which improved and new tools continue to appear. On the other hand, formal verification can suffer from problems such as state-space explosion or modeling inaccuracy. Then, it is vital to develop new ways to check a design for consistency fast and comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a sequential equivalence checking (SEC) formalism and an algorithm, for use between a specification, written at electronic system level (ESL), and an implementation, written at RTL. Given that equivalence is checked between different levels of abstraction, it is no longer valid to perform SEC on single states, thus, we show a scheme to extract and compare complete sequences of states in order to determine if the design intention, which is described in the ESL specification, is contained and respected by the RTL implementation. The results obtained suggest that our methodology can be applied efficiently on real designs.","","978-1-4799-0595-9","","10.1109/LATW.2013.6562666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562666","RTL implementation;equivalence checking;formal methods;high-level specification","","formal verification","ESL specification;RTL hardware design;behavioral inconsistency;digital application complexity;electronic system level;formal equivalence checking;formal verification;functional specification;modeling inaccuracy;register transfer level;sequential equivalence checking formalism;state space explosion","","","","0","","16","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Designing in this abstraction level needs new languages and methods to describe, synthesize, test, and verify systems. ESL design methodology is a way to handle the complexity of designing digital systems, and decrease time-to-market by starting the design from higher abstraction level than Register Transfer Level (RTL). Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) has emerged in the direction of system level design. TLM is originally based on high level programming languages such as C++ and SystemC. In this paper a hardware-aware ESL design methodology is proposed. The proposed methodology includes several levels containing various architecture models and guidelines for design at each level. A Test Data Compression (TDC) system is implemented as a case study using TLM-2.0 standard.","","978-1-4244-9555-9","","10.1109/EWDTS.2010.5742064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5742064","ESL;TLM;architecture;memory;methodology","Design methodology;Hardware;Memory architecture;Sockets;Switches;Timing","circuit CAD;high level languages;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design","C++;SystemC;TLM-2.0 standard;abstraction level;architecture exploration;digital design;electronic system level;high level programming languages;register transfer level;system level design;test data compression;time-to-market;transaction level modeling","","","","1","","3","","","20110405","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though most state-of-the-art commercial tools have tried very hard to provide all the levels of details to satisfy the different requirements of the software designer, the hardware designer, and even the system architect, the hardware/software co-simulation speed is dramatically slow when co-simulating the hardware models at the register-transfer level (RTL) with a full-fledged operating system (OS). Our experimental results show that the combination of QEMU and SystemC can make the co-simulation at the CA level much faster than the conventional RTL simulation, even with a full-fledged operating system up and running. Furthermore, the statistics indicate that with every instruction executed and every memory accessed since power-on traced at the CA level, it takes 28m15.804s on average to boot up a full-fledged Linux kernel, even on a personal computer. Compared to the kernel boot time reported by Xilinx and SiCortex, the proposed CA-ISS is about 6.09 times faster compared to “SystemC without trace” of Xilinx and about 30.32 times faster compared to “SystemC models converted from RTL” of SiCortex. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) a hardware/software co-simulation environment capable of running a full-fledged OS at the early stage of the electronic system level design flow at an acceptable simulation speed is proposed; 2) a virtual platform constructed using the proposed CA-ISS as the processor model can be used to estimate the performance of a target system from system perspective, which all the previous works, such as QEMU-SystemC, do not provide; and 3) such a virtual platform also provides the modeling capability from the transaction level down to the CA level or the other way around.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2010.2095631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5737847","Cycle-accurate simulation;ISS;QEMU;SoC;hardware/software co-simulation;systemC","Data mining;Estimation;Hardware;Linux;Pipelines;Software;System-on-a-chip","Linux;hardware-software codesign;instruction sets;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","CA level;CA-ISS;OS;QEMU;RTL;RTL simulation;SiCortex;SoC development;SystemC-based cycle-accurate ISS;Xilinx;cycle-accurate instruction set simulator;electronic system level design flow;full-fledged Linux kernel;full-fledged operating system;hardware designer;hardware-software cosimulation speed;performance estimation;personal computer;processor model;register-transfer level;software designer;system architect;system-on-chip development;virtual platform","","","","4","","47","","","20110322","","IEEE","IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It will be the key-issue of ESL methodology. It might be tightly related with software architecture and it is different point of view from typical upstream design of hardware. We developed ESL based simulation environment for modeling logic SoC used in mobile phones at the upstream design phase (during planning phase, before logic design).

Productivity is enforced with High-Level Synthesis (HLS) or Electronic System Level (ESL) or C-based hardware design methodologies, that offer an efficient abstraction level to boost-up early prototyping. However, just like the migration from schematics to Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) required specific coding styles for efficient hardware design, C-based hardware design also requires efficient coding guidelines to be followed. This paper presents a set of such coding guidelines, and evaluates their efficiency for FPGA based scientific, floating point arithmetic calculations. As found through extensive experimentation, the performance and area optimizations offered by efficient coding can improve the ones offered by HLS only, even more than 90%. So, while not every C program can be turned into hardware with the press of a button, efficient coded C programs can offer a profitable productivity boost.","","","","10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701691","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Encoding;Field programmable gate arrays;Guidelines;Hardware;Optimization","C language;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;floating point arithmetic;hardware description languages;high level synthesis;medical signal processing","C level hardware design;C program;C-based hardware design method;ESL;FPGA based scientific floating point arithmetic calculations;FPGA device;GFLOP;HDL;HLS;abstraction level;area optimization;coding guidelines;computational complexity;early prototyping;electronic system level;embedded system design;field programmable gate array;floating point biomedical DSP application;hardware description language;high-level synthesis;power efficiency;productivity;time-to-market schedule","","","","0","","","","","20140109","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, often this is not an issue, since simulation execution appears to be deterministic due to deterministic SystemC scheduler implementations. However, to satisfy the increasing need for simulation speed, parallel SystemC engines are being researched: With no fixed strict total order among LPs executed in parallel, nondeterministic behavior is more likely to surface and more difficult to debug, threatening the viability to use simulation especially for debugging use-cases. This work presents a new method to test for nondeterminism: Anomalies are detected by running a simulation twice in sequential simulation mode while systematically varying the PEO, and without the need for source code analysis.

"ESL - the next leadership opportunity for India?","Naumann, Alan","","VLSI Design, 2005. 18th International Conference on","3-7 Jan. 2005","2005","","","26","","Summary form only given. This paper lectures on the increasingly critical role played by electronic system level (ESL) design tools in the development of the complex system-on-chip (SoC) devices that are now the indispensable engines of advanced consumer and communications products. Drawing upon his experience in managing CoWare, which has world-class software development resources in India, the author argues that ESL tool development expertise can be an effective differentiator for Indian software engineering. This paper discusses the growing impact of SoC technology on the global electronics market, and the factors driving it. In particular, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the design cost per gate continues to fall - because rising mask costs are more than offset by the massive increase in the number of gates per chip. This increase in gate capacity presents SoC designers not only with a significant market opportunity, but also with a serious design challenge - how to integrate so much functionality into one chip without the multiple re-spins that destroy a product's time to market and bury its design budget. Also discussed is the ESL design methodology, and it is argued that the adoption of such a methodology is a pre-requisite for meeting this SoC design challenge. This paper argues that Indian engineers - with their proven expertise in software modelling and development - can occupy a pole position in this new industrial revolution.","1063-9667","0-7695-2264-5","","10.1109/ICVD.2005.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383245","","Consumer electronics;Costs;Engineering drawings;Engineering management;Engines;Programming;Resource management;Software development management;Software engineering;System-on-a-chip","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit technology;software engineering;system-on-chip","ESL design methodology;India;Indian software engineering;SoC design;SoC technology;complex system-on-chip devices;electronic system level design tools;embedded systems;global electronics market;leadership opportunity","","","","0","","","","","20050124","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) is state-of-the-art for describing complex communication without all the details. As ESL language, SystemC has become the de facto standard. Since the SystemC TLM models are used for early software development and as reference for hardware implementation their correct functional behavior is crucial. Admittedly, the best possible verification quality can be achieved with formal approaches. However, formal verification of TLM models is a hard task. Existing methods basically consider local properties or have extremely high run-time. In contrast, the approach proposed in this paper can verify “true” TLM properties, i.e. major TLM behavior like for instance the effect of a transaction and that the transaction is only started after a certain event can be proven. Our approach works as follows: After a fully automatic SystemC-to-C transformation, the TLM property is mapped to monitoring logic using C assertions and finite state machines. To detect a violation of the property the approach uses a BMC-based formulation over the outermost loop of the SystemC scheduler. In addition, we improve this verification method significantly by employing induction on the C model forming a complete and efficient approach. As shown by experiments state-of-the-art proof techniques allow proving important non-trivial behavior of SystemC TLM designs.","","978-1-4244-7885-9","978-1-4244-7886-6","10.1109/MEMCOD.2010.5558643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558643","","Monitoring;Object oriented modeling;Resumes;Safety;Time domain analysis;Time varying systems;Unified modeling language","C++ language;digital systems;discrete event simulation;electronic engineering computing;finite state machines","abstract models;electronic system level design;finite state machines;monitoring logic;system level properties;transaction level modeling;untimed SystemC TLM designs","","","","3","","24","","","20100826","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is generally agreed that an approach to taming the complexity is to properly raise the level of abstraction to that of system-level designs. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is considered appropriate to specify abstract systems. To support the gap between UML and low level hardware descriptions, a few pilot tools and methodologies were proposed by both the EDA community and the academia. However, these tools either lack support for cycle accurate system specifications in UML or ignore the efficiency issue in cycle accurate system specifications based on UML. In this paper, an improved method is proposed to efficiently specify systems at cycle accuracy by significantly simplifying clock control modelling. This method is further supported by an improved translator to convert UML 2.0 specifications into executable SystemC descriptions. We believe that our method would be a significant contribution to the electronic system level (ESL) tools.","","978-0-7695-3006-2","","10.1109/IPC.2007.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438443","","Bridges;Clocks;Embedded system;Hardware;Microelectronics;Pervasive computing;Process design;Sequential circuits;System-level design;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic design;sequential circuits","UML 2.0 modelling;Unified Modelling Language;cycle accurate system specification;cycle accurate verification;electronic system level tools;embedded systems;executable SystemC description;low level hardware description;synchronous sequential circuit;system-level design","","","","0","","6","","","20080122","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new power consumption estimation methodology for embedded systems is proposed. First, the Functional Level Power Analysis (FLPA) is used to set up generic power models based on real board measurements. In the second step, a simulation framework is developed to evaluate accurately the architectural parameters of the elaborated power models. The proposed methodology has several benefits: it improves significantly the accuracy of the functional level approach and the power consumption estimation can be accomplished without a costly and complex material. In order to speed up the estimation process, our methodology refers to the selection of data pattern size and to the application sampling technique.

Current paper presents an automated approach to correcting system-level designs. We propose dynamic-slicing and location-ranking-based method for accurately pinpointing the error locations combined with a dedicated set of mutation operators for automatically proposing corrections to the errors. In order to validate the approach, experiments on the Siemens benchmark set have been carried out.

This paper presents a new out-of-order simulator for multi-core parallel DE simulation of hardware/software designs at any abstraction level. By localizing the simulation time and carefully handling events at different times, a system model can be simulated following a partial order of time. Subject to automatic static data analysis at compile time and table-based decisions at run time, threads can be issued early which reduces the idle time of available cores.

However, there often exists a gap between control engineering and system design. The control engineer has detailed knowledge about the algorithms but is abstracting from the system architecture and implementation. On the other hand, the system designer aims at achieving high-quality implementations based on quality constraints specified by the control engineer. This may result in either an overdesigned system in case the specifications are pessimistic or an unsafe system behavior when specifications are too optimistic. Thus, future design automation approaches have to consider the quality of control applications both as design objectives and design constraints to achieve safe yet highly optimized system implementations. The work at hand introduces an automatic tool flow at the Electronic System Level (ESL) that enables the optimization of a system implementation with quality of control being introduced as a principal design objective, like the maximum braking distance, while respecting constraints like maximum slip to ensure maneuverability of a car. The gap between mathematically well-defined models for system synthesis and common analysis techniques for control quality is bridged by co-simulation: A SystemC-based virtual prototype of a distributed controller implementation is combined with high-level models of the plants specified in Matlab/Simulink. Through a model transformation, the traditional development process of control applications is combined with state-of-the-art ESL techniques, ensuring model consistency while enabling a high degree of automation.","","978-1-4673-2295-9","978-1-4673-2296-6","10.1109/SAMOS.2012.6404200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404200","","Actuators;Delay;MATLAB;Sensors","braking;control engineering;control system synthesis;embedded systems;networked control systems;optimisation;virtual prototyping","Matlab;Simulink;SystemC-based virtual prototype;automatic tool flow;common analysis techniques;control applications;control engineering;control system design;cosimulation approach;design automation approaches;distributed controller implementation;electronic system level;embedded control systems;high-quality implementations;maximum braking distance;maximum slip;modern networked embedded systems;optimized system implementations;principal design objective;quality constraints;state-of-the-art ESL techniques;system architecture;system synthesis;system-level analysis;unsafe system behavior","","","","0","","21","","","20130110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to this prediction, if we want to take advantage of technological evolutions, designer's productivity has to increase in the same proportions. To take up this challenge, system level design solutions have been set up, but many efforts have still to be done on system modelling and synthesis. In this paper we propose a computation core synthesis methodology that can be integrated on the communication refinement steps of electronic system level design tools. In the proposed approach, computation cores used for digital signal processing application specifications relying on coarse grain communications and synchronizations (e.g. matrix) can be refined into computation cores which can handle fine grain communications and synchronizations (e.g. scalar).

Such cores can be used to model fine grain input output overlapping or iteration pipelining.

ESL verification methodology is employed in the design regression of EPC C1Gen2 RFID tag. Around 200 times speedup is observed using ESL over conventional RTL simulation in regression runs (after logic bug fixes). This clearly shows ESL verification is a successful candidate to reuse high-level test harness for IC functional verification, especially in today's increasingly complex IC design world. On top of the successful use of the ESL functional verification flow on the design, we also show the infrastructure to use SystemC Verification Library (SCV) for formal verification.

One of the main components of the long turn-around-time for closing power is generating activity files at gate level or at register-transfer-level (RTL) to analyze the power. This paper describes a method to reduce the power-analysis run time multiple orders of magnitude maintaining gate-level power-analysis accuracy. To reduce the run-time dramatically for power analysis, novel activity-propagation and port-mapping algorithms to convert automatically from electronic-system-level (ESL) activity file to RTL vcd (value change dump) file and to gate-level vcd file have been proposed. After obtaining all vcd files in each level, we can do power analysis without accuracy degradation at RTL and at gate level. In this method, a huge amount of run time for simulation in each level is reduced. By analyzing a variety of digital circuits, we demonstrate the run-time of our methodology is an order of magnitude faster than traditional method at RTL and multiple orders of magnitude faster at gate level with less than 1% accuracy degradation of RTL and gate-level power analysis.","","978-1-4244-5034-3","978-1-4244-5035-0","10.1109/SOCDC.2009.5423822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5423822","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computational modeling;Degradation;Design engineering;Humans;Personal digital assistants;Power engineering and energy;Runtime;Very large scale integration","integrated circuit design;logic design","VLSI design;activity propagation algorithm;digital circuits;electronic system level activity;gate level power analysis accuracy;inter-hierarchical power analysis methodology;port mapping algorithm;register transfer level;value change dump file","","","","1","","","","","20100304","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As new generations of technology have become accessible, die dimensions and clock frequencies have increased causing ever-larger switching currents to be drawn from the power supply. Interconnections routed at the chip level, bonding wires and package frames act as antennas that cause parasitic radiation (IC radiated emissions) while radio frequency (RF) currents that superimpose the nominal currents (power and signal currents) at the IC ports drive the unintentional emissions of printed circuit board (PCB) traces (IC-conducted emissions). Recognizing the importance of IC EMEs, equipment manufacturers are beginning to require semiconductor companies to specify the IC emission levels. For these reasons, research activities in the field of characterization techniques of ICs in terms of EMEs are receiving increasing attention, and several methods have been proposed to measure the EMC performances of ICs. A new method to measure IC-conducted EMEs using a backward-wave (BW) directional coupler is presented in this paper. The coupler consists of two-coupled microstrip lines employed to measure the spectrum of the current delivered through IC pins with low invasiveness and high repeatability. The operation principle of the method is described and the design criteria for the coupler are given. The results of experimental tests performed using the coupler are compared with those obtained with a standard technique to prove the effectiveness of the method.","0018-9456","","","10.1109/TIM.2010.2047970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462860","Electromagnetic compatibility;emission;integrated circuits (ICs);microstrip directional couplers;standardization","","directional couplers;electromagnetic compatibility;integrated circuit bonding;integrated circuit measurement;microstrip lines;monolithic integrated circuits;printed circuits","EMC;IC emission levels;IC-conducted emissions;backward-wave directional coupler;electromagnetic emissions;electronic system level;integrated circuits;parasitic radiation;power supply;printed circuit board;radio frequency currents;switching currents","","","","1","","11","","2010-05-10","20100607","","IEEE","IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the early stages of this flow, the Electronic System Level (ESL) description style, and languages such as SystemC TLM, enable high-level debugging of the SoC functionality. In the last stages, hardware blocks become RTL or gate level (VHDL or Verilog) descriptions. We have developed two autonomous Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) solutions, for SystemC TLM platforms and for VHDL/Verilog IP blocks: designs are automatically instrumented with ad hoc property checkers produced from requirements formalized as PSL assertions. Furthermore, for a comprehensive and seamless verification flow, analogous requirements should be verifiable before and after ESL-to-RTL hardware refinement. This requires the transformation of ESL assertions into their counterparts at the RT level. This paper discusses this issue and proposes a first set of transformation rules for the automatic refinement of PSL assertions from the system level to the signal level.

This embedded tutorial introduces the audience to the concept of ASIPs and uses practical examples to illustrate how ASIP architectures can be mapped to applications.

In this paper we illustrate different aspects of using analogue line models as a transmission method for transactions between TLM models. This includes the introduction of analogue signal paths for TLM models and how to avoid the simulation time penalty of analogue technology models.

The extraction of data from system designs written in SystemC is thereby crucial e.g. for the proper understanding of a given system. However, no satisfactory support of reflection/introspection of SystemC has been provided yet. Previously proposed methods for this purpose either focus on static aspects only, restrict the language means of SystemC, or rely on modifications of the compiler and/or parser. In this work, we present an approach that overcomes these limitations. A methodology is introduced which enables full extraction of the desired information from a given SystemC design without changing the SystemC library or the compiler. For this purpose, debug symbols generated by the compiler and SystemC API calls are exploited. The proposed system retrieves both, static and dynamic information. A comparison to previously proposed solutions shows the benefits of the proposed method, while its application is illustrated by means of a visualization engine.","2159-3469","","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2013.6654618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654618","","Adders;Data mining;Hardware;Information retrieval;Libraries;Software systems;Standards","C language;application program interfaces;hardware-software codesign;program debugging","ESL;SystemC API;SystemC design;compiler;data extraction;debug symbol;electronic system level;hardware-software codesign;static aspect;visualization engine","","","","0","","","","","20131107","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional technology scaling of semiconductor chips followed Moore's Law. However, the transistor performance improvement will be limited, and designer will not see doubling of frequency every two years. Recently, three-dimension integrated circuits (3D IC) that employ the vertically through-silicon vias (TSVs) for connecting each of dies have been proposed. It is an alternative solution to existent Package-on-Package (PoP) and System-in-Package (SiP) processes. There are many benefits by using TSV-based 3-D integration technologies: (1) more functionality can be integrated into a small silicon space for form factor reduction, (2) circuit delay can be improved by using TSVs due to the shorter interconnect and reduced parasitic capacitance/inductance, (3) different components with incompatible manufacturing process (i.e. Logic, DRAM, Flash, etc) can be combined in single 3-D IC for heterogeneous integration. In addition, there are many 3-D multi-core or many-core architectures are discussed recently. Comparing with traditional two-dimension multi-core or many-core architectures, the major difference is memory bandwidth problem can be addressed by stacked memory architecture. Intel has good demonstration through the teraflops microprocessor chip which is an 80-core design with memory-on-logic architecture. And, each core connects to a 256KB SRAM with 12GB/s bandwidth. Although 3-D stacking technology can bring us many benefits for next generation integrated circuits, it comes with many problems and challenges in system-level design. For instance, 3-D IC designs will deal with serious challenges in design space exploration and system validation. For most designs, the number of TSV will be the most critical limitation that should be considered carefully. Besides, system design by 3-D IC will become more and more complex, and it needs a full system-level solution to face the performance, number of TSV, and power issues of 3D-IC. Furthermore, i- - t is more challenge to provide a FPGA-based prototyping system for early-stage software development. In general, the continue increasing complexity of modern SoC or embedded system design is also extreme. To achieve the required design productivity for the time-to-market pressure, a common accepted solution is using electronic system-level (ESL) design methodology to design the system in the different design abstraction level. One of the key technologies of ESL solution is to construct the HW/SW co-simulation platform by using the virtual prototyping concept. Moreover, designers need a multiphase of virtual platform construction to meet the different targets of design stage, such as early system validation and architecture exploration. In this work, we create a simulation framework by using ESL methodology to explore 3-D IC system that consists of multi-core processors with extended stacking memory. To demonstrate our 3-D IC design techniques, the stacking memory approach is employed in our “3D-PAC (Parallel Architecture Core)” design. In 3D-PAC, we stack SRAM directly on top of the logic die which is heterogeneous multi-core computing platform for multimedia application purpose. The logic die is mainly consists of a general-purpose microprocessor, dual programmable digital signal processor (DSP) cores, AXI/AHB/APB subsystems, and various peripherals. Furthermore, we had the corresponding virtual platform (PAC Duo virtual platform) which had been used for early architecture exploration, power estimation and HW/SW co-simulation. The difference with PAC Duo design, the target of 3D-PAC is to provide a three-dimensional SoC (3-D SoC) design exporation for media-rich and multi-function portable devices. Although using the stacking memory approach with TSV technology can increase the capacity and performance of memory system significantly, but the placement and organization of the memory system are the nother important design issues.

To nail down these design errors early, a better debugging support of RTL memory on the software side is extremely useful. We present a just-in-time shadow memory technique that can allow debugging of RTL memory from a software perspective. While cosimulation is fast compared to a complete hardware based simulation, the communication and synchronization overhead between the hardware and software simulators can be very significant. Since the two simulators have to communicate almost every cycle, a good communication platform is necessary to reduce this extra overhead. To evaluate this overhead, we implement and evaluate three communication primitives for a real system design with ARM926EJ-Sprocessor and RTL memory.

Abstraction-based methodologies have been developed resulting in Electronic System Level (ESL) design. A prominent language for ESL design is SystemC offering different levels of abstraction, interoperability and the creation of very fast models for early software development. For the verification of SystemC models, Constrained Random Verification (CRV) plays a major role. CRV allows to automatically generate simulation scenarios under the control of a set of constraints. Thereby, the generated stimuli are much more likely to hit corner cases. However, the existing SystemC Verification library (SCV), which provides CRV for SystemC models, has several deficiencies limiting the advantages of CRV.

To avoid data hazards and ensure timing accuracy, this technique requires the compiler to statically analyze the design model for potential data access conflicts. In this paper, we propose a compiler optimization that improves the data conflict analysis by exploiting instance isolation.

We present a modeling library on top of SystemC, targeting heterogeneous embedded system design, based on four models of computation. The library has a formal basis where all elements are well defined and lead in construction of analyzable models. The semantics of communication and computation are implemented by the library, which allows the designer to focus on specifying the pure functional aspects.

But even if the complexity of the systems can be handled using the abstraction levels offered by TLM - the most abstract one is untimed and focuses on functionality - still verification is the major bottleneck. In particular, as untimed TLM models are the reference for the following refinement steps their correctness has to be ensured. Thus, formal verification approaches have been developed to prove properties for these models. However, even if several properties have been checked this does not guarantee that the complete functionality of the TLM model has been verified. Thus, in this paper we consider the problem of functional coverage analysis in formal TLM property checking. We present a coverage approach which can analyze whether the property set unambiguously describes all transactions in a SystemC TLM model. The developed coverage analysis method identifies uncovered scenarios and hence allows to close all coverage gaps.

It is critical for these processor power models to be useable across various modeling abstractions in an electronic system level (ESL) design flow, to guide early design decisions. In this paper, we propose a unified processor power modeling methodology for the creation of power models at multiple granularity levels that can be quickly mapped to an ESL design flow. Our experimental results based on applying the proposed methodology on the OpenRISC and MIPS processors demonstrate the usefulness of having multiple power models. The generated models range from very high-level two-state and architectural/instruction set simulator models that can be used in transaction level models, to extremely detailed cycle-accurate models that enable early exploration of power optimization techniques.

Quality Electronic Design","16-18 March 2009","2009","","","535","540","Electronic system level (ESL) is regarded as a necessary solution to deal with the ever increasingly complex system-on-chip (SoC) design. Most ESL designs are modeling at the C high-level language (no matter functional C or SystemC). Although some commercial products are partially available, the lack of directly translating C or SystemC into RTL becomes a main obstacle to a seamless ESL flow from high level abstraction through RTL and all the way to the final chip design. We propose an efficient semi-hardware description language called VeriC (Verilog and C) to bridge ESL and RTL. Like SystemC, VeriC is based on C++ and not only describes the design by a syntax very close to Verilog, but also it can model the target design at both pin and cycle accuracy with an implicit clock mechanism, a modeling way closer to Verilog. Those VeriC modules can be directly translatable to RTL and also can be interoperable with other modules in C/SystemC/Verilog languages by hybrid simulation. Our objective is not to replace SystemC, but to move the RTL model up to a higher level such that detailed cycle-accurate implementation can be present even in C-level simulation, a supplemental and more efficient approach for bridging the gap between ESL design and RTL models. Experimental results show that the VeriC simulation speed can be 2-10times faster than SystemC, because of the improvement in the simulation kernel (by taking advantages of input/output connections and a simpler cycle mechanism). It can also reach 10times-250times simulation speedup than Verilog in simulating the same behavior.","","978-1-4244-2952-3","978-1-4244-2953-0","10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810351","Cycle/Pin accurate;Debugging interface;Fast Co-simulation;Fast ESL flow;Implicit clock;Semi-hardware description language","Bridges;Chip scale packaging;Clocks;Debugging;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hardware design languages;High level languages;Kernel;Runtime;Watches","C++ language;electronic engineering computing;hardware description languages;high level languages;open systems;system-on-chip","C high-level language;C++;C-level simulation;SoC;SystemC;VeriC;VeriC modules;Verilog;electronic system level;final chip design;hybrid simulation;semihardware description language;system-on-chip","","","","2","","7","","","20090403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, today's system-level design methodologies usually focus on the abstraction of digital logic and time, so that typical low-power aspects cannot be considered so far. In this paper, we present a high-level modeling approach on top of the SystemC/TLM standard to simulate power distribution and voltage based implications in a ""loosely-timed"" functional execution context. The approach reuses legacy TLM models and prevents the need for detailed lock-step process synchronization in contrast to existing methods.

Therefore, low power optimization techniques are strongly applied during the development of modern application specific instruction set processors (ASIPs). Electronic system level design tools based on architecture description languages (ADL) offer a significant reduction in design time and effort by automatically generating the software tool-suite as well as the register transfer level (RTL) description of the processor. In this paper, the automation of power optimization in ADL-based RTL generation is addressed. Operand isolation is a well-known power optimization technique applicable at all stages of processor development. With increasing design complexity several efforts have been undertaken to automate operand isolation. In pipelined datapaths, where isolating signals are often implicitly available, the traditional RTL-based approach introduces unnecessary overhead. We propose an approach which extracts high-level structural information from the ADL representation and systematically uses the available control signals.

In this paper, to reduce power consumption of heterogeneous processor, a power management algorithm is proposed with a time-based power control architecture which autonomously performs voltage/clock scaling operations without the intervention of the processors. The proposed algorithm has adaptively adjusted time-threshold levels for voltage/clock control to minimize the power consumption and work in severe time-constraints for real-time processing. The real-time adjustment makes robust performance of the power consumption guarantee regardless of patterns of data traffic and diverse application programs.

Among various modeling technologies underlying ESL tools, synchronous dataflow (SDF) and its related models of computation have been successfully used to model and simulate many wireless standards. However, LTE physical layer involves dynamically varying data processing rates that make SDF insufficient due to its constant-rate constraint. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Mixed-mode Vector-based Dataflow (MVDF), to efficiently model and simulate LTE physical layer by exploring the matched-rate nature of LTE and by combining static and dynamic dataflow technologies. We have implemented MVDF in an ESL tool, called SystemVue, along with a complete LTE physical layer library. With the implementation, we are able to create LTE reference designs for performance measurements.

Also, there is yet to be a standard for applying IP power modelling that fits with a TLM terminology and into the overall system modelling process. Although power is hardly analyzed today even at the RTL level, “access” to power at the ESL domain may become much more critical, given the impact designers can have on power behaviour at this level. Ideally, software developers can also gain visibility into power dynamics and adjust their development flow to accommodate power guidelines, as well. With the current isolated HW and SW flows, this may seem unrealistic. What are some of the pitfalls of being “too early” in applying new technologies?

Particular strengths of Simulink are rapid design and algorithm exploration. Moreover, commercial tools are available to generate embedded C or HDL code directly from a Simulink model. On the other hand, Simulink models are purely functional models and, hence, designers cannot seamlessly consider the architecture that a Simulink model is later implemented on. In particular, it is not possible to explore the different architectural alternatives and investigate the arising interactions and side-effects directly within Simulink. To benefit from Matlab/Simulink's algorithm exploration capabilities and overcome the outlined drawbacks, this work introduces a model transformation framework that converts a Simulink model to an executable specification, written in an actor-oriented modeling language. This specification then serves as the input of well-established Electronic System Level (ESL) design flows that, e. g., enables Design Space Exploration (DSE) and automatic code generation for both hardware and software. We also present a validation technique that considers the functional correctness by comparing the original Simulink model with the generated specification in a co-simulation environment. The co-simulation can also be used to evaluate the performance of implementation candidates during DSE. As case study, we present and investigate a torque vectoring application from an electric automotive vehicle.","1636-9874","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6646658","Actor-oriented Design;Code Generation;DSE;Matlab/Simulink;System-level Validation;SystemC","Computational modeling;Generators;Hardware;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers);Registers;Software packages","","","","","","0","","","","","20131028","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to RTL, TL models (TLM) are more abstract and do not contain micro-architectural details for instance; the design focus is on high-level control and data flow. Since TLMs are essential at the decision process in early system development and as they can serve as golden reference models for later RTL regression, it is imperative to ensure that they implement the specification correctly.

This makes it challenging to develop reliable hardware through hand-crafted RTL implementations. The problem is exacerbated with aggressive time-to-market requirements, leading to a design productivity gap. Electronic System Level (ESL) design is often seen as a solution to this gap: the idea is to raise the design abstraction by specifying a hardware design behaviorally with a high-level language (e.g., SystemC).

According to SIGNAL's polychronous model of computation, we propose a model for AADL, which takes both software, hardware and allocation into account. This model enables an early phase timing analysis and synthesis via tools associated with Polychrony.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952285","AADL;Polychrony;Synthesis","Clocks;Computational modeling;Instruction sets;Processor scheduling;Timing","hardware description languages;high level synthesis","AADL language;SIGNAL synchronous language;abstraction level;electronic system design;formal framework;high-level analysis;high-level modeling;phase timing analysis;system complexity;system-level codesign;system-level synthesis;time to market constraint","","","","1","","23","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems can integrate many disparate computing elements, and often contain soft processors hosting application components. Soft processors are sequential, synchronous devices with low computational density, and are not capable of exploiting the concurrency available on the FPGA. We present a method for increasing the computational density of application-specific systems by eliminating soft processors within these systems. This method eliminates soft processors by replacing programs that would be hosted on soft processors with custom, self-contained, circuitizable finite-state machine with datapath (FSMD) components that are automatically generated. We show that FS-MDs produced using this method eliminate the computational overhead associated with fetching and decoding instructions. We further show that this method, when applied to interrupt-driven programs, can produce concurrent FSMDs that arbitrate for shared datapath resources. We discuss how these FSMDs are capable of leveraging the spatial computational capabilities of the FPGA and are therefore more aptly suited for deployment within application-specific systems. We show that these FSMDs eliminate overhead associated with interrupt context switching, decrease interrupt servicing latencies, and eliminate interrupt livelock. We discuss implications and limitations of this method, and describe a prototype that implements the method for programs targeted for the Intel 8051.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952293","automatic synthesis;behavioral synthesis;binary synthesis;compiler;embedded systems","Clocks;Design automation;Field programmable gate arrays;Instruction sets;USA Councils","field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;microprocessor chips","Intel 8051;application-specific systems;computational density;decoding instruction;fetching instruction;field programmable gate array;finite-state machine with datapath;interrupt-driven program;reconfigurable computing platform;soft processors hosting application","","","","0","","27","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cyber-physical systems (CPS), however, computation time is a correctness factor: missed deadlines for hard real-time applications, such as avionics and automobiles, can result in devastating, life-threatening consequences. Although many modern modeling languages for CPS include the notion of time, implementation languages such as C lack any temporal semantics. Consequently, models and programs for CPS are neither portable nor guaranteed to execute correctly on the real system; timing is merely a side effect of the realization of a software system on a specific hardware platform. In this position paper, we present the research initiative for a precision timed (PRET) infrastructure, consisting of languages, compilers, and microarchitectures, where timing is a correctness factor. In particular, the timing semantics in models and programs must be preserved during compilation to ensure that the behavior of real systems complies with models.

Modeling constructs, models of computation, and timing models at the system level need to be developed so that hardware and software can be uniformly modeled, and later partitioned after simulation based profiling. In this session, two papers will be presented, one on data structures for unified modeling, and another on a unified model of computation. The first paper describes a HW/SW codesign template library (CTL). It allows the usage of high level complex data structures for design space exploration by replacing complex data structures with specific library components for either HW or SW. For HW designs, the library provides the opportunity to map data structures to specific memory structures and it contributes to achieve an efficient memory usage. In the second paper, the authors propose a cyber physical system modeling approach based on process networks. The proposed approach supports Kahn process networks, timed dataflow and signal flow graphs as well as their interfacing. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness of this unified view of models of computation.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952278","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent work has proposed distributing FPGA circuit applications in a SystemC bytecode to be emulated on a processor with portions possibly dynamically migrated to custom bytecode accelerator circuits or to native circuits on the FPGA. We introduce a novel JIT compiler for bytecode executing on a soft-core FPGA processor. During an iterative process of JIT compiler and emulator architecture codesign, we added JIT-aware resources on a soft-core processor's surrounding FPGA fabric, including a JIT memory, a signal queue, and an emulation memory controller - all unique to JIT compilation for FPGA processors versus traditional processors. Experiments show that regular JIT compilation achieved 3.0× average speedup over emulation, while our JIT-aware FPGA resources yielded an additional 5.2× average speedup, for a total of 15.7× average speedup, at a cost of 21% of a MicroBlaze processor core's slice usage.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952282","","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Random access memory;Software","electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;just-in-time;logic design;program compilers;random-access storage","JIT compiler;JIT memory;SystemC bytecode;emulation memory controller;emulator architecture codesign;just-in-time compilation;processor-independent instruction;signal queue;soft-core FPGA processor","","","","0","","25","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper targets system level throughput optimization in streaming pipelined MPSoCs under process variation. First, to maximize system level throughput, we make extensive use of data parallelism of the streaming applications to map them to multiple cores available on a chip. In order to tackle the effect of process variation in clock frequency of these cores, and the resulting deterioration in system timing yield, we propose to deploy frequency scaling and configuration selection for each core. We incorporate timing yield constraint during task replication and load balancing for data parallel tasks. The novel contribution of this work is that we perform all these operations simultaneously, and show the benefits of our approach. We present an ILP solution for maximum throughput under process variation and the proposed solution determines the right degree of parallelism at target timing yield. Our proposed ILP formulation is very generic and can be used for task replication of single or multiple tasks, while simultaneously performing optimum load balancing. The results show that the MPSoC system design flows that do not consider one or more than one of the above mentioned design decisions simultaneously, suffer greatly from the design failures and fail to meet strict timing yield and bandwidth constraints. The throughput of such an MPSoC system is also worse than half of the throughput of our proposed system.","2117-4628","978-1-4673-1630-9","978-2-9539987-7-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240584","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Equations;Parallel processing;Program processors;Throughput;Timing","integer programming;integrated circuit design;linear programming;system-on-chip","ILP formulation;MPSoC system design;clock frequency;configurable MPSoC;configuration selection;data parallel task;delay distribution;die-to-die variation;frequency scaling;optimum load balancing;process variation-aware task replication;streaming pipelined MPSoC;system level throughput optimization;system timing yield;target timing yield;within-die variation","","","","0","","9","","","20120716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, its application to HW/SW embedded system specification and design requires specific features not covered by the language. For this reason, the MARTE profile for Real-Time and Embedded systems was defined. It has proven to be powerful enough to support holistic system modeling under different views. This single-source model is able to capture the required information, enabling the automatic generation of executable and configurable models for fast performance analysis without requiring additional engineering effort. As a result of this performance analysis suitable system architecture can be decided. At this point, the SW stack to be executed by each processing node in the selected heterogeneous platform has to be generated. In the general case this is a tedious and error-prone process with little assistance from available tools. Current practices oblige the SW engineer to develop the code for each node of the heterogeneous multi-core platform by hand. The code has to be written specifically for the selected architecture and architectural mapping, thus reducing reusability. In order to overcome this limitation, the FP7 PHARAON project aims to develop tools able to automatically generate the code to be executed in each node from the initial system model. This affects not only the application code, the static and run-time libraries (e.g. OpenMP/OpenCL), the middleware and communication functions, but also the OS and the driver calls in each node.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573222","MARTE;MPSoC;SW synthesis;UML","Analytical models;Concurrent computing;Embedded systems;Object oriented modeling;Semantics;Standards;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;middleware;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","FP7 PHARAON project;HW-SW embedded system;MDE;MPSoC;OpenCL;OpenMP;UML-MARTE models;architectural mapping;driver calls;heterogeneous multicore platform;holistic system modeling;middleware;model driven engineering;multiprocessing system-on-chip;real time systems;software development;system synthesis","","","","0","","41","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The environment with which the cyber-physical device interacts, such as lungs for a medical ventilator device or a busy freeway for an autonomous vehicle, may be complex and subsequently difficult to explore all possible configurations. Computer simulations that utilize device and environment behavioral models may be used as a first stage of testing, but at some point development must occur using the real device running in real-time. We present a codesign framework for aiding cyber-physical device development where real devices or prototypes are connected to real-time models that simulate the interacting environment. Such test setups are known as digital mockups and allow for testing environment scenarios that are hard to capture with commonly-used but limited physical mockups. The framework supports model hardware/software codesign to enable models of varying speed and accuracy to be implemented within an embedded processor or as a custom coprocessor circuit on an FPGA. We describe an accompanying tool that generates code templates to reduce the time required to develop digital mockup test setups. We utilize the framework to build a digital mockup test setup for a commercial ventilator, and showcase codesign capabilities by implementing environmental models as both circuits and as instructions on a processor.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952295","Cyber-physical systems;codesign;coprocessor;digital mockups;modeling","Computational modeling;Coprocessors;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Transducers;Unified modeling language","application specific integrated circuits;coprocessors;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;medical computing","FPGA;application-specific codesign platform generation;commercial ventilator;coprocessor circuit;cyber-physical device development;cyber-physical systems;digital mockup test setup;hardware-software codesign","","","","1","","17","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The formalism used here combines FSM's to encode overall structure, PSL-like properties to encode behavior within a state, and concepts of variables to make description more compact.

Much like application specific processors, our methodology starts from a known instruction set architecture and customizes it to create the final implementation. However, our approach goes further as we not only add custom functional units and define the parameters of the register file, but we also remove unneeded interconnect, which results in a data path that looks more similar to that created by high level synthesis tools. We show that there are substantial opportunities for eliminating unused resources, which results in an architecture that has significantly smaller area. We compare area, delay and performance results of a base architecture with trimmed one. Preliminary results show by only trimming wires we have an average of 25% area reduction while improving the performance around 5%.

Currently, the analysis is performed on the formal specifications through Boolean abstractions. Even though it is a sound abstraction, for more precise analysis we might have to refine the abstraction. Refining the abstraction level from pure Boolean to a theory of Integers can lead to more precise decisions. In this paper, we first show how integrating a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver to POLYCHRONY compiler can enhance its decision making capabilities. Further, we show, how a polyhedral analysis library integrated to the compiler, can compute safe operational boundaries, and filter unsafe input combinations to keep the system safe. We enhanced the POLYCHRONY compiler's ability to make more accurate decisions and to accept and characterize the safe input range for specifications where safety may be violated for a relatively small region of a large input space. The enhancement also allows the user to consider the severity of the violation with respect to entire space of inputs, and either reject a specification or synthesize a wrapped software with guaranteed safe operation.","2117-4628","978-1-4673-1630-9","978-2-9539987-7-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240593","","Abstracts;Analytical models;Clocks;Computational modeling;Libraries;Safety;Synchronization","decision making;formal specification;program compilers","Boolean abstractions;SMT solver;decision making capability;deterministic software synthesis;embedded software synthesis;formal specifications;integer theory;polychronous framework;polychrony compiler;polyhedral analysis library;safety wrappers;safety-critical cyber physical systems;satisfiability modulo theory;sound abstraction","","","","1","","17","","","20120716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a hierarchical scheduling algorithm using the ideas of ant colony, whose run time complexity is at the same scale as ordinary list scheduling, while generating results as good as the classic ant-colony scheduling algorithm. In practice, this implies a very substantial run-time improvement, enabling scheduling exploration of much larger problems while avoiding the pitfalls of over-constraint and lower quality results that hierarchical solutions are generally known for.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573217","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Schedules;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms","ant colony optimisation;microprocessor chips;processor scheduling","ant colony scheduling algorithm;list scheduling;run time complexity;scalable high quality hierarchical scheduling;scheduling exploration","","","","0","","16","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method first consists of deriving, from a Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) algorithm description, a Memory Exclusion Graph (MEG) that models all the memory objects of the application and their allocation constraints. Based on the MEG, memory allocation can be performed at three different stages of the implementation process: prior to the scheduling process, after an untimed multicore schedule is decided, or after a timed multicore schedule is decided. Each of these three alternatives offers a distinct trade-off between the amount of allocated memory and the flexibility of the application multicore execution. Tested use cases are based on descriptions of real applications and a set of random SDF graphs generated with the SDF For Free (SDF3) tool. Experimental results compare several allocation heuristics at the three implementation stages. They show that allocating memory after an untimed schedule of the application has been decided offers a reduced memory footprint as well as a flexible multicore execution.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573219","","Memory management;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Resource management;Runtime;Schedules;Timing","data flow graphs;multiprocessing systems;scheduling;storage allocation;system-on-chip","MEG;SDF For Free;SDF algorithm description;SDF3 tool;allocation heuristics;application multicore execution;memory allocation;memory exclusion graph;memory objects;multiprocessor system-on-chip;random SDF graphs;reduced memory footprint;shared memory MPSoC;synchronous dataflow","","","","0","","12","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Partial controller retiming in high-level synthesis","Sobue, R.; Hara-Azumi, Y.; Tomiyama, H.","Dept. of Electron. & Comput.

However, they focus only on the datapath and cannot handle the controller delay even though most critical paths lie across the controller and datapath (i.e., from state registers in the controller to storage units in the datapath) and the controller delay occupies the non-negligible portion of the paths. This paper proposes a novel HLS technique to remove such controller delays. Our method, “Register-Transfer (RT) level register retiming”, is applied to only parts of the control logic, which generate control signals of multiplexers (MUXs) on critical paths, in such a way that generates and stores the signals into registers in the previous cycle. It then lets the MUXs obtain their control signals directly from the registers, leading to reduction in critical path delay. Experiments on several benchmark programs demonstrate that our RT-level retiming can achieve comparable clock improvement while mitigating area overhead, compared with conventional gatelevel retiming.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573209","High-level synthesis;multiplexers;register retiming","Benchmark testing;Clocks;Delays;Hardware;Logic gates;Registers;Transform coding","clocks;high level synthesis;multiplexing equipment;optimisation","clock frequency;high-level synthesis;multiplexers;optimization techniques;partial controller retiming;register-transfer level","","","","0","","16","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thereby, low level tools can be utilized for accurate design parameter estimation, which helps to evaluate the effect of system level design decisions. Especially complex data structures pose a problem in this context. The different structure of memory in hardware and software requires different data structure implementations. With the presented data structure library a consistent design flow from a high level system model to either a hardware or software implementation is enabled. The concept extends the idea of abstract data types across the hardware/software boundary. Container adapters with appertaining implementations for system level simulation, hardware and software implementation support the designer throughout the whole design process. The benefit of the presented library is demonstrated and evaluated by a case study.

"Enabling the synthesis of very long operation properties","Langer, J.; Horn, T.; Heinkel, U.","Chemnitz Univ. of Technol., Chemnitz, Germany","Electronic System Level Synthesis Conference (ESLsyn), 2011","5-6 June 2011","2011","","","1","6","In previous work, the high-level synthesis of operation properties has been proposed. In this work, we improve the existing algorithms in order to allow the synthesis of more efficient hardware models. Especially for very long properties no model could be generated before, because both the runtime of the synthesis process and the amount of used hardware resources were prohibitively high. The proposed improvements are threefold. First, the generated non-deterministic control automaton is replaced by a deterministic automaton using an optimized power set construction algorithm. This significantly reduces the number of registers in the generated model. Second, a property can contain local variables (freeze variables), that capture a value at a specific time step and provide this value throughout a property's life span. The scheduling of storage registers for these variables has been optimized. The last improvement merges equivalent assignments to output or state variables (commitments). The merging avoids not only the generation of redundant hardware resources but also simplifies the output multiplexer of the model. Finally, a case study is presented that involves an industrial design of a framer component. The design properties describe the processing of a complete data frame of 19440 cycles length. High-level synthesis and subsequent logic synthesis have been successful and show that the design methodology and synthesis algorithms result in a design with resource usage similar to the industrial component.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952292","","","logic design;memory architecture;processor scheduling","deterministic control automaton;hardware models;logic design methodology;logic synthesis;optimized power set construction algorithm;redundant hardware resources;storage register scheduling;very long operation properties","","","","0","","18","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

While they increase productivity in implementing a single complex hardware module, synthesizing and optimizing many hardware components simultaneously is still an open problem. In particular, resource sharing is typically only performed for single components, thereby neglecting optimization possibilities across concurrent modules. On the other hand, domain-specific models and specifications, which are generally seen as a key ingredient to raise the level of abstraction in future design flows, may enable such global optimizations. In this paper, we present a model-based approach for inter-process resource sharing which provides for efficient high-level synthesis of streaming applications modeled as a set of communicating processes.

Since this leads to time-abstract system models the main challenge is to deal with the concurrency between the individual RTL components. We propose a compositional scheme describing the communication between SoC modules independently of their individual processing speed.

The rise of multicore systems in all domains of computing has opened the door to heterogeneous multiprocessor, where processors of different compute characteristics can be combined to effectively boost the performance per watt of different application kernels. GPUs and FPGAs are becoming very popular in PC-based heterogeneous systems for speeding up compute intensive kernels of scientific, imaging and simulation applications. GPUs can execute hundreds of concurrent threads, while FPGAs provide customized concurrency for highly parallel kernels. However, exploiting the parallelism available in these applications is currently not a push-button task. Often the programmer has to expose the application's fine and coarse grained parallelism by using special APIs. CUDA is such a parallel computing API that is driven by the GPU industry and is gaining significant popularity. In this work, we adapt the CUDA programming model into a new FPGA design flow called FCUDA, which efficiently maps the coarse and fine grained parallelism exposed in CUDA onto the reconfigurable fabric. Our CUDA-to-FPGA flow employs autopilot, an advanced high level synthesis tool which enables high abstraction FPGA programming. FCUDA is based on a source-to-source compilation that transforms the SPMD CUDA thread blocks into parallel C code for autopilot. We describe the details of our CUDA-to-FPGA flow and demonstrate the highly competitive performance of the resulting customized FPGA multi-core accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CUDA-to-FPGA flow to demonstrate the applicability and potential advantage of using the CUDA programming model for high-performance computing in FPGAs.","","978-1-4244-4939-2","978-1-4244-4938-5","10.1109/SASP.2009.5226333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226333","","Clocks;Computer industry;Concurrent computing;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Kernel;Moore's Law;Parallel processing;Power dissipation;Yarn","application program interfaces;field programmable gate arrays;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures","CUDA kernel;FPGA programming;Moores law;application program interface;clock frequency;compute unified device architecture;computing industry;field programmable gate array;graphics processing unit;multicore system;multiprocessor system;parallel processing;performance per watt boosting;power dissipation","","","","16","","23","","","20090828","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we show that, for many dataflow-dominated application models, such accelerating traces may be efficiently determined. Trace determination is based on a novel symbolic search technique.

"Exploiting just-enough parallelism when mapping streaming applications in hard real-time systems","Zhai, J.T.; Bamakhrama, M.A.; Stefanov, T.","Leiden Inst. of Adv. Comput.

It has been shown that the various forms of parallelism in an application should be explored to achieve the maximum system performance. However, if more parallelism is revealed than needed, it will overload the underlying MPSoC platform. At the same time, the revealed parallelism should be sufficient such that the MPSoC platform is fully utilized. Therefore, the amount of revealed and exploited parallelism has to be just-enough with respect to the platform constraints. In this paper, we study the problem of exploiting just-enough parallelism by application task unfolding, when mapping streaming applications modeled using the Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) MoC onto MPSoC platforms in hard real-time systems. We show that our problem of simultaneously unfolding and allocating tasks under hard real-time scheduling has a bounded solution space and derive its upper bounds. Subsequently, we devise an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, while the obtained solution meets a pre-specified quality. The experiments on a set of real-life streaming applications demonstrate that our algorithm results, within reasonable amount of time, in a system specification with large performance gain. Finally, we show that our proposed algorithm is on average 100 times faster than one of the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, i.e., NSGA-II genetic algorithm, while achieving the same quality of solutions.","0738-100X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560763","","Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Parallel processing;Real-time systems;Resource management;Upper bound;Vectors","data flow graphs;embedded systems;processor scheduling;system-on-chip","MPSoC;embedded streaming applications;exploiting just-enough parallelism;hard real-time systems;multiprocessor system-on-chip;parallel models of computation;real-life streaming applications;streaming application mapping;synchronous data flow;tasks allocation","","","","0","","","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic principle of error-tolerance is that some chips may occasionally produce erroneous outputs, but still provide acceptable performance when used in certain systems. Using these chips in such systems results in an increase in effective yield. In this paper, a fault-oriented test methodology is presented for classifying whether or not a chip is acceptable based on error rate estimation. A sampling method is proposed to estimate error rate associated with each possible fault in the target circuit. According to this information, an approach is developed to identify a list of faults that are acceptable with respect to a specified upper bound on expected error rates of acceptable chips. Furthermore, a test pattern selection method, and an output masking technique are presented to identify tests which detect all of the unacceptable faults, and as few acceptable faults as possible, so as to maximize the effective yield. Experimental results indicate the high effectiveness of the proposed error rate estimation method, and the degree to which yield can be enhanced.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2008.916875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4453874","Acceptable faults;effective yield;error rate;error-tolerance;output masking;test pattern sampling;test pattern selection","","VLSI;error detection;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;integrated circuit yield;system-on-chip","SOC;effective yield;error rate based test methodology;error-tolerance;fault detection;nanometer VLSI circuitry;output masking technique;system-on-a-chip;test pattern selection method;very large scale integrated circuitry","","","","2","","13","","","20080303","","IEEE","IEEE Reliability Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IsoNet is a lightweight job queue manager responsible for administering the list of jobs to be executed, and maintaining load balance among all CMP cores. By exploiting a micro-network of load-balancing modules, the proposed mechanism is shown to effectively reinforce concurrent computation in many-core environments. Detailed evaluation using a full-system simulation framework indicates that IsoNet significantly outperforms existing techniques and scales efficiently to as many as 1024 cores. Furthermore, to assess its feasibility, the IsoNet design is synthesized, placed, and routed in 45-nm VLSI technology. Analysis of the resulting low-level implementation shows that IsoNet's area and power overhead are almost negligible.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2202699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6243223","Job queue;load balancing;many-core;multicore","Computer architecture;Hardware;Instruction sets;Load management;Parallel processing","microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;queueing theory","CMP;IsoNet;VLSI technology;chip multiprocessor;conflict-free dynamic load distribution;hardware-based job queue management;lightweight job queue manager;load balancing;many-core architectures;micronetwork;size 45 nm","","","","0","","40","","2012-07-18","20130520","","IEEE","IEEE Circuits and Systems Society;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To ensure the correctness of the specified systems, approaches have been presented which automatically verify whether a UML model is consistent, i.e. free of conflicts. However, if the model is inconsistent, these approaches do not provide further information to assist the designer in finding the error. In this work, we present an automatic debugging approach which determines contradiction candidates, i.e. a small subset of the original model explaining the conflict. These contradiction candidates aid the designer in finding the error faster and therefore accelerate the whole design process. The approach employs different satisfiability solvers as well as different debugging strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that, even for large UML models with up to 2500 classes and constraints, the approach determines a very small number of contradiction candidates to be inspected.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176655","","Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Correlation;Debugging;Encoding;Engines;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;hardware-software codesign;program debugging","automatic debugging;defacto standard;hardware/software codesign;inconsistent UML/OCL models;program debugging;software systems;unified modeling language","","","","3","","21","","","20120403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evaluating system hardware with a variety of spectral and emitter scenarios helps characterize system performance in the presence of multiple emitters of interest and potential interferers that can be either non-intentional or intentional. DAC technology has evolved to the point where wide instantaneous bandwidths and high resolution is available with the current generation of arbitrary waveform generators (AWG). The true power of an AWG is in its ability to generate virtually any waveform downloaded into its memory making it easy to create radar and communications emitters scattered across a synthetic test range that simulates thousands of cubic miles of airspace. This paper will propose new approaches to spectrum and emitter simulation using high precision AWGs and investigate their use in applications which in the past have required a much more complicated, costly and multi-instrument solution. It will explore unique methods for baseband waveform creation, extending scenario length through the efficient use of memory, and upconversion of wideband composite signals to RF and microwave frequencies.","","978-1-4673-5177-5","","10.1109/RADAR.2013.6652044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6652044","EW;electronic warfare;emitter;emulation;multistatic radar;passive radar;radar;simulation;spectrum","Bandwidth;Modulation;Radar applications;Radio frequency;Signal generators;Testing","electronic warfare;function generators;military radar;radar clutter","AWG;DAC technology;RF frequency;arbitrary waveform generators;baseband waveform creation;cluttered electromagnetic environment;communications emitters;electronic warfare systems;emitter simulation;microwave frequency;multiinstrument solution;multiple emitters;radar emitters;radar systems;spectrum simulation;wideband composite signals","","","","0","","","","","20131104","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, while searching for a valid implementation a substantial amount of time is spent on timing analysis during system synthesis. This paper presents a novel system synthesis approach that efficiently prunes the search space in case real-time constraints are violated. For this purpose, the reason for a constraint violation is analyzed and a deduced encoding removes it permanently from the search space. Thus, the approach is capable of proving both the presence and absence of a correct implementation. The key benefit of the proposed approach stems from its integral support for real-time constraint checking. Its efficiency, however, results from the power of deduction techniques of state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. Using a case study from the automotive domain, experiments show that the proposed system synthesis approach is able to find valid implementations where former approaches fail. Moreover, it is up to two orders of magnitude faster compared to a state-of-the-art approach.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981813","Algorithms;Design","Decision trees;Encoding;Real time systems;Resource management;Routing;Schedules;Timing","computability;search problems;timing","Boolean satisfiability solvers;stringent real-time constraints;symbolic system synthesis;timing analysis","","","","1","","12","","","20110811","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Concurrently, as process technology scales, the design effort for realizing very large scale integrated circuits and the associated costs are becoming critically high. A possible solution to address this performance/costs challenge is given by customizable multiprocessor system-on-chips. The approach proposed in this paper leads to the customization of multi/many processor system-on-chip at two levels of abstraction: 1) customization through application-specific hardware accelerators implemented on configurable datapath that can target three kinds of structured application-specific integrated circuit technologies: metal, via, and runtime programmable and 2) customization of the architectural parameters of the platform. The proposed platform is equipped with a design framework that assists the user in the high-level design-space exploration of signal processing applications described using the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) language. A peculiar added value of the flow is to support the migration of OpenCL kernels and tasks into pipelined hardware accelerators described using a C-level language. The platform is able to provide an average performance of 90 GOPS on a set of reference signal processing applications, and an average computational energy efficiency of 130 GOPS/W in its metal-programmable configuration. This result shows the benefits in terms of energy efficiency of hardware customization applied to multiprocessor systems with respect to many core devices such as general-purpose graphic processing units, able to provide on average 2.5 GOPS/W for the applications under analysis.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2280295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603356","Application-specific signal processor (ASSP);metal-programmable structured application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) (MPSA);multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC);platform-based design;reconfigurable computing.","","","","","","","0","","","","2013-09-18","","","IEEE","IEEE Circuits and Systems Society;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The time and money spent on such boards are usually high. A versatile verification/fast prototyping platform consisting of an FPGA board and the associated System Software is presented. The FPGA board is connected to the host computer through a peripheral component interconnect interface. The System Software running on a Microsoft Windows environment is developed so that all the real-time data that were generated during the verification process can be downloaded and displayed on the host computer. Hence, the system acts like a logic analyzer with very large storage memory. Furthermore, the software provides interfaces for personal computer peripherals, such as a Universal Serial Bus camera, a computer monitor, and a soundcard, if the test data for multimedia applications are necessary. The results can be also demonstrated in real time through these devices. Because multimedia data are usually complicated, and the size is huge, the design and thorough verification are usually difficult and take lots of time. The proposed system is both versatile and convenient to use, and verification of designs becomes much easier. An MPEG-4 Simple Profile Video Encoder and a 3-D surround sound processor were realized with the proposed system. Both cases can run in real time.

In fact, stress engineering is becoming more and more widely used today in advanced IC manufacture processes to improve device performance. Different from the intentionally introduced stresses to improve circuit performance, the shallow-trench-isolation (STI) stress, which is exerted by STI wells on the active area of devices, is a by-product of the fabrication process and has increasingly significant impact on the circuit behavior. This paper proposes a complete flow to characterize the influence of STI stress on the performance of RF/analog circuits by considering detailed layout and process information. An accurate and efficient finite-element method-based stress simulator has been developed to extract stress distribution from layouts of IC designs. The existing MOSFET model is also enhanced to capture the effects of stress on mobility, threshold voltage. With the enhanced model, we are able to study the influence of layout-dependent STI stress on the performance of real circuits and establish corresponding optimization strategies. The proposed flow has been applied to a series of RF/analog IC designs based on a 90-nm CMOS technology.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2102374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703168","Layout-dependent;modeling;optimization;parallel processing;simulation;stress","Circuit optimization;Integrated circuit modeling;Layout;Shape;Solid modeling;Stress;Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;analogue integrated circuits;circuit optimisation;finite element analysis;isolation technology;radiofrequency integrated circuits;stress analysis","CMOS technology;IC manufacture process;MOSFET model;RF/analog IC design;RF/analog circuit;finite-element method;layout-dependent STI stress analysis;shallow-trench-isolation stress;size 90 nm;stress distribution;stress engineering;stress simulator;stress-aware circuit optimization;threshold voltage","","","","0","","30","","2011-01-28","20120216","","IEEE","IEEE Circuits and Systems Society;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Reliability problems arise from permanent errors due to manufacturing, process variations, aging as well as soft errors. As a result, the hardware will consist of unreliable components and hence, the development of embedded systems has to change fundamentally. Therefore, we propose a dependability-aware design approach for hardware systems through integrating dependability into a state-of-the-art system-level design language. Our approach is based on SystemC and extends the Program State Machine model to explicitly observe, diagnose, and compensate faulty behavior. Different compensation mechanisms like run-time reconfiguration or mechanisms for error propagation can be used by the designer during refinement. They are controlled by a new exception-like mechanism. Furthermore, our approach aims to integrate functional verification as well as dependability verification with respect to given fault models.","","978-1-4577-0303-4","978-0-7695-4377-2","10.1109/ISORCW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753527","","Adaptation model;Circuit faults;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Switches","embedded systems;finite state machines;hardware-software codesign;reliability","Moore law;SystemC;continuous shrinking;dependability-aware design;embedded systems;extended program state machines;hardware systems;reliability;transistor sizes","","","","0","","30","","","20110421","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

An analyzing of the similarities and differences between these two decoding processes shows that CAVLC can be effectively merged into a CABAC decoder. Experimental results show that about 1.5K gates can be saved using the proposed reconfigurable cell (RC) architecture, which corresponds to a 25.4% area savings in the implementation of the CAVLC decoder. Using the idle time in RC arrays, the base cell can be extended to carry out the inverse transform with very limited overhead.

The advantage of developing such a model resides in the possibility of performing an early validation of the response of the image sensor to the input light. The parameterized model can model many optical and electrical effects at a high level of abstraction. The sensor response to the light and to its control signals can be rapidly simulated for checking the compliancy to the sensor specifications. SystemC AMS can model complex heterogeneous systems at different levels of abstraction using different models of computation (MoCs). The model uses the timed data flow (TDF) MoC of SystemC AMS. Simulation results are shown and future works are forecasted to enrich the accuracy of the sensor model by adding noise sources and non-linearities. The overall image acquisition platform will then be, in a near future, validated by integrating the SystemC AMS model inside a SystemC TLM virtual platform.","","978-1-4577-0171-9","978-1-4577-0169-6","10.1109/VLSISoC.2011.6081614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081614","Image sensor modeling;SystemC AMS;bayer filter;early validation;image correction algorithms;image signal processing","Arrays;Band pass filters;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Optical filters;Photodiodes;Semiconductor device modeling","CMOS image sensors;hardware description languages;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;signal processing","CIS;CMOS image sensor;CMOS video sensor;TDF;analog-mixed-signal extension;electrical effects;model complex heterogeneous systems;optical effects;parameterized model;systemC AMS behavioral modeling;systemC hardware description language 1666 IEEE standard;timed data flow MoC","","","","0","","8","","","20111117","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many tone mapping algorithms are proposed for rendering HDR images or videos on display screens. The choice of tone mapping algorithm depends on characteristics of displays such as luminance range, contrast ratio and gamma correction. An ideal HDR tone mapping processor should include several tone mapping algorithms and be able to select an appropriate one for different kind of devices and applications. Such a HDR tone mapping processor has characteristics of robust core functionality, high flexibility, and low area consumption. An ARM core based system on chip (SOC) platform with HDR tone mapping ASIC is suitable for such applications. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology to develop an optimized architecture for tone mapping processor in the ARM SOC platform. We illustrate the approach by a HDR tone mapping processor that can handle both photographic and gradient compression. The optimization is achieved through four major steps: common module extraction, computation power enhancement, hardware/software partition and cost function analysis. Based on the proposed scheme, we develop an integrated photographic and gradient compression HDR tone mapping processor that can process 1024times768 images at 60 fps.

A senior-level course named Hardware/Software Codesign provides a practical introduction to these complex system design issues. The challenge is to bring a subject, which is traditionally covered as a graduate-level course, to senior undergraduate students without overly narrowing down the scope, and without turning the course into an ad-hoc design project. The course combines an incremental, structured overview of hardware/software codesign with practical assignments that emphasize key concepts. This paper reviews the motivations for this course, the curriculum, the lab materials and tools used, and the results of the first offering of the course in fall 2006. </para>","0018-9359","","","10.1109/TE.2007.910434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472099","Computer architecture;education;hardware design languages;logic design;modeling;simulation software","Application software;Code standards;Computer architecture;Computer industry;Costs;Hardware design languages;Logic design;Software design;Software standards;Turning","computer science education;educational courses;hardware-software codesign","electronic system design;graduate-level course;hardware-software codesign;programmable architectures;senior undergraduate students;senior-level course","","","","5","","22","","2008-03-14","20080805","","IEEE","IEEE Education Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Layout-Aware and Programmable Memory BIST Synthesis for Nanoscale System-on-Chip Designs","Kokrady, A.; Ravikumar, C. P.; Chandrachoodan, N.","Texas Instrum.","Asian Test Symposium, 2008. ATS '08. 17th","24-27 Nov. 2008","2008","","","351","356","Debugging memory test failures in a system-on-chip design is becoming difficult due to the growing number and sizes of the embedded memories. Low-complexity marching tests, which are ideally suited for production testing, are insufficient for debug and diagnostics. On-chip support for multiple memory test algorithms can be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, memory test engineers would like the flexibility to make small changes to the test sequence. Run-time programmability can be provided through the use of programmable finite state machines and/or microcode in the BIST controllers. Since such controllers have higher area requirement, it is difficult to employ multiple controllers and distribute them geographically on the chip. Therefore, the BIST controller can become a routing hot-spot. Existing memory BIST insertion flows operate on a post-synthesis net-list and ignore the constraints that will be posed by the physical design step that will follow. These constraints include routing congestion and interconnect timing. Similarly, the synthesis of the BIST logic must also address area, test application time and test power constraints. In this paper, we formulate the problem of programmable memory BIST synthesis as an optimization problem and describe an implementation. Results show upto 3X improvement in area and wirelength for industrial designs when a layout-aware flow is used as opposed to manual BIST implementation.","1081-7735","978-0-7695-3396-4","","10.1109/ATS.2008.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711616","PBIST;Routing;Test-Time","Automata;Built-in self-test;Debugging;Logic testing;Production;Routing;Runtime;System testing;System-on-a-chip;Timing","built-in self test;circuit complexity;finite state machines;integrated circuit design;nanotechnology;network routing;programmable circuits;system-on-chip","built-in self test;debugging memory test failures;embedded memories;interconnect timing;layout-aware flow;low-complexity marching tests;multiple memory test algorithm;nanoscale system-on-chip designs;optimization problem;physical design step;post-synthesis net-list;production testing;programmable finite state machines;programmable memory BIST synthesis;routing hot-spot;run-time programmability;test application time;test power constraint;test sequence","","","","2","","16","","","20081212","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work extends a binary utility generator based upon the ArchC ADL by providing a technique for automatically retargeting disassemblers and debuggers.

There are multiple motivations which lead designers to consider low-power design such as increasing lifetime, improving battery longevity, limited battery capacity, and temperature constraints. Unfortunately, there is a lack of efficient methodology and accurate tool to obtain power/energy estimation of a complete system at different abstraction levels. This paper presents a global framework for power/energy estimation and optimization of heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC). Within this framework, a power modeling methodology is defined, and an open platform is developed. Our methodology takes into account all the embedded system relevant aspects; the software, the hardware, and the operating system. The platform stands for Open Power and Energy Optimization PLatform and Estimator (Open-PEOPLE). It includes diverse estimation tools with respect to their abstraction levels in order to cover the overall design flow. Starting from functional estimation and down to real boards measurements, our platform helps designers to develop new power models, to explore new architectures, and to apply optimization techniques in order to reduce energy and power consumption of the system. The usefulness and the effectiveness of the proposed power estimation framework is demonstrated through a typical embedded system conceived around the Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198327","Multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC);power modeling;system-level estimation","Computational modeling;Embedded systems;Estimation;Hardware;Power demand;Program processors","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;multiprocessing systems;optimisation;power aware computing;system-on-chip","Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform;abstraction levels;electronic domains;energy consumption reduction;energy estimation;functional estimation;heterogeneous MPSoC;heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip optimization;low-power complex embedded system design;open power and energy optimization platform and estimator;open-PEOPLE platform;optimization techniques;power consumption reduction;power estimation;power modeling methodology;power models;power-aware design","","","","0","","58","","2012-05-10","20121219","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Industrial Applications Society;IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;IEEE Robotics and Automation Society;IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

FASTCUDA is a platform that provides the necessary software toolset, hardware architecture, and design methodology to efficiently adapt the CUDA approach into a new FPGA design flow. With FASTCUDA, the CUDA kernels of a CUDA-based application are partitioned into two groups with minimal user intervention: those that are compiled and executed in parallel software, and those that are synthesized and implemented in hardware. A modern low power FPGA can provide the processing power (via numerous embedded micro-CPUs) and the logic capacity for both the software and hardware implementations of the CUDA kernels.

In addition, we propose three novel algorithms based on our new methods to minimize the number of registers that need to be initialized, which can reduce the routing resources used by the reset signals and alleviate the routing problem.

In this paper, we focus on ensuring model correctness under parallel execution. In particular, the model must be free of race conditions in all accesses to shared variables, so that a safe parallel implementation is possible. Eliminating race conditions is difficult because discrete event simulation often hides such flaws. In particular, the absence of simulation errors does not prove the correctness of the model. We propose to use advanced conflict analysis in the compiler, fast checking in a parallel simulator, and a novel race-condition diagnosis tool, that not only exposes all race conditions, but also locates where and when such problems occur.

Embedded processors that contain cache memories open an opportunity for the low-power research community to model the impact of cache energy consumption and throughput gains. Power consumption is as important as performance in battery-powered embedded systems and in future, embedded processors are to process more computation-intensive applications with limited power budgets. Therefore, power consumption of theses processors will become more critical. According to the high contribution of memory access power in total power consumption of embedded systems, memory architecture of embedded systems strongly influences the system design objectives. Therefore, the embedded system designer requires a comprehensive design space exploration for memory architecture. In this paper we explore the design space of cache in embedded processors to find out the cache sizes which have the optimum performance/power consumption in embedded applications.","","978-1-4673-0495-5","","10.1109/NESEA.2011.6144938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144938","Embedded processor;cache;design space exploration;optimum size;power consumption;power per performance","Benchmark testing;Embedded systems;Energy consumption;Power demand;Program processors;Space exploration;System-on-a-chip","cache storage;embedded systems","battery-powered embedded systems;cache energy consumption;cache memories;computation-intensive applications;design space exploration;embedded processors;memory access power;memory architecture;on-chip power consumption;performance per power optimum cache architecture;power budgets;throughput gains;very deep submicron technologies","","","","0","","28","","","20120202","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, previous work based on a single, fixed-order TRC often requires long test time to achieve high fault coverage and large storage space to store required control data and TRC seeds. In this paper, a novel programmable multiple-TRC-based on-chip test generation scheme is proposed to minimize both the required test time and test data volume. The scan path of a circuit under test is divided into multiple equal-length scan segments, each converted to a small-size TRC controlled by a programmable control logic unit. An efficient algorithm to determine the required seeds and the control vectors is developed. Experimental results on ISCAS'89, ITC'99 and IWLS'05 benchmark circuits show that, on average, the proposed scheme using only a single programmable TRC design can achieve 35.58%-98.73% reductions on the number of test application cycles with smaller storage data volume compared with previous work. When using more programmable TRC designs, 83.60%-99.59% reductions can be achieved with only slight increase on test data volume.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2013.2253155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6559094","Circuit testing;logic BIST;twisted-ring-counters","Built-in self-test;Circuit faults;Process control;Radiation detectors;Switches;System-on-chip;Vectors","built-in self test;counting circuits;programmable logic devices","ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits;ITC'99 benchmark circuits;IWLS'05 benchmark circuits;TRC seeds;built-in test pattern generators;control data;control vectors;fault coverage;high-performance circuits;multiple twisted-ring counters;on-chip test generation scheme;programmable control logic unit;programmable counters;scan path;single programmable TRC design;storage space;test application cycles;test data volume;test time","","","","0","","22","","","20130715","","IEEE","IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The on-chip interferers inevitably propagate from other active circuits like digital backend processors through silicon substrate coupling in the same die of system-level integration. An in-system diagnosis platform of RF ICs presented in this paper relates the impacts of such interferers on the circuit-level response and system-level communication performance metrics. The figures of communication quality at a system level, like EVM, BER and throughput are concurrently evaluated with the strengths of interferers in different forms and at different locations in a silicon chip. The interferers are measured as the in-band signal to spurious power ratio at the output of RF ICs, the magnitude of substrate voltage fluctuations at the proximity of RF ICs, and related with the amount of power current consumed by base-band digital ICs. The tolerance of RF ICs is represented by the maximum strength of on-chip interferers for sustaining prescribed communication performance. The diagnosis system is divided into two parts, (i) a system-level RF simulator handling modulation and demodulation of real communication vectors in LTE format and also enabling hardware connectivity with RF ICs, and (ii) a silicon emulator of on-chip interferers coupled to the RF ICs. A 65 nm CMOS chip incorporates an on-chip arbitrary noise generator, an on-chip waveform capture, and RF IC for LTE receiver front end, and demonstrates the entire diagnosis.","1089-3539","","","10.1109/TEST.2013.6651922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651922","on-chip measurements;radio frequency integrated circuits;substrate noise coupling","Couplings;Noise;Radio frequency;Standards;Substrates;System-on-chip;Wireless communication","CMOS integrated circuits;Long Term Evolution;radiofrequency integrated circuits;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels","BER;CMOS chip;EVM;LTE receiver front end;LTE standards;RFIC tolerance;active circuits;baseband digital IC;communication quality;communication vector demodulation;communication vector modulation;digital backend processors;in-system diagnosis platform;on-chip arbitrary noise generator;on-chip in-band interferers;on-chip waveform capture;power current;silicon chip;silicon emulator;silicon substrate coupling;size 65 nm;system-level RF simulator;system-level communication performance metrics;system-level integration;wireless channels","","","","0","","","","","20131104","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being strongly dependent on future design decisions and low-level parameters, the challenge results, how to derive power estimates from uncertain knowledge about later implementation details. For that purpose, high-level approaches are available, which either perform top-down synthesis and a power characterization of the concrete low-level system or re-use abstract characteristics of high-level components to derive power models and to calculate the power consumption of the composed system. Hence, these approaches suffer either performance or accuracy, due to the tradeoff between generating and considering implementation details respectively due to the inaccuracy of abstractions. Additionally, reliability of such estimations is uncertain, since system and component power models lack general validity and a traceable provability within the composed, extra-functional design space of power, function and time. To address this lack of power-closure, this paper suggests power contracts to formalize power properties and as a foundation for a more traceable, provable and thus reliable power-aware design flow. For that purpose, we introduce the formal basics of contract-based design, discuss their improvements within the design flow and propose their application within the domain of power, giving an outlook on a formal way towards power-closure.","","","","10.1109/PATMOS.2013.6662156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662156","","Clocks;Connectors;Context;Contracts;Ports (Computers);Power demand;Timing","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;power aware computing;power consumption","component power models;contract-based design;energy consumption;high-level components;low-level parameters;low-level system;microelectronics;power closure;power consumption;power contracts;power properties;power-aware design;reliability;space exploration;uncertain knowledge","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Loop tiling is a widely used transformation in such methodologies for dimensioning of such accelerators in order to match inherent massive parallelism of considered algorithms with available functional units and processor elements. Innately, the applications are data-flow dominant and have almost no control flow, but the application of tiling techniques has the disadvantage of a more complex control and communication flow. In this paper, we present a methodology for the automatic generation of the control engines of such accelerators. The controller orchestrates the data transfer and computation. The effect of tiling on area, latency, and power overhead of the controller is studied in detail. It is shown that the controller has a substantial overhead of up to 50% in for different tiling and throughput parameters.

In contrast to the conventional wisdom that PKC is too “expensive” for M2M sensors, it actually can lower the total cost of ownership because of cost savings in provision, deployment, operation, maintenance, and general management. Furthermore, PKC can be more energy-efficient because PKC-based security protocols usually involve less communication than their symmetric-key-based counterparts, and communication is getting relatively more and more expensive compared with computation. More importantly, recent algorithmic advances have brought several new PKCs, NTRUEncrypt and TTS included, that are orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional PKCs such as RSA. It is therefore our primary goal in this paper to demonstrate the feasibility of using hardware-based PKC to provide general data security in M2M applications.","2156-3357","","","10.1109/JETCAS.2013.2244772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6472114","Bluespec SystemVerilog;lattice-based cryptography;multivariate cryptography","","application specific integrated circuits;cryptographic protocols;mobile communication;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","ASIC implementation;M2M security;M2M sensors;NTRUEncrypt;PKC-based security protocols;RSA;TTS;hardware-assisted PKC;machine-to-machine system security;post-quantum public key cryptography;post-quantum public-key cryptosystems;symmetric key-based counterparts","","","","0","","22","","2013-03-07","20130307","","IEEE","IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, a deadlock situation may occur if these transactions are not properly manipulated. In this paper, we address the deadlock problem in an on-chip bus system supporting out-of-order transactions. We present a graphic model that can well represent the status of a bus system and show that a cycle exists in the graph if and only if the bus system is in an unsafe state that may lead to a bus deadlock. Based on this model, we propose a novel bus design technique that can efficiently resolve the bus deadlock problem. Experimental results show that buses with the proposed technique can be up to 3.3 times faster than those with the currently available techniques.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2248765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6490417","Advanced eXtensible interface (AXI);bus deadlock;on-chip bus;open core protocol (OCP);out-of-order execution;tagged transactions.","","","","","","","0","","","","2013-03-29","","","IEEE","IEEE Circuits and Systems Society;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Assertions are expressed in the PSL language, and the verification that the system fulfils these properties is performed dynamically i.e., during simulation. We have previously reported our results about the development of a dedicated ABV methodology that makes use of automatically generated checkers and of ad hoc observation mechanisms. The technique has also been improved to support the PSL Modeling Layer which enables the use of (global) auxiliary variables in assertions. A prototype tool, called ISIS, implements all these features. However, supporting the notion of global variables in assertions is not sufficient in general, for instance when components have a pipelined behaviour, thus enabling the simultaneous processing of several data. We propose here yet another improvement of the method, that provides for considering reentrant assertions (i.e., assertions simultaneously evaluated for different data) through the use of multiple checker instances, with local variables. We extend the PSL syntax with an appropriate syntactical construct, we adapt the semantics accordingly, and we describe the implementation in our tool. Experimental results are also reported.","","978-1-4244-7885-9","978-1-4244-7886-6","10.1109/MEMCOD.2010.5558642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558642","","Context;Monitoring;Semantics;Switches;Syntactics;Time domain analysis;Time varying systems","formal verification;pipeline processing;specification languages;transaction processing","ABV methodology;PSL Modeling Layer;PSL language;Reentrancy;SystemC transactional level modelling;TLM design;assertion-based verification;auxiliary variable;pipelined behaviour;simultaneous data processing","","","","2","","24","","","20100826","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, side channel leakage is confirmed by measuring actual prototypes, or by detailed SPICE level simulations of the hardware model. However, this feedback does not help the designer: it comes either too late (after the implementation), or else it has unreasonable simulation time requirements. In this paper, we present a design method to provide early feedback on side channel leakage based on toggle counting. We show how to abstract the low level circuit effects, such as glitches and routing imbalances, into high level simulation models that can be toggle counted. Furthermore, we propose an acceleration method for fast toggle counting using reconfigurable hardware.

In this paper, we generate assertions from system level designs using GoldMine, an automatic assertion generation engine that uses data mining and static analysis. Candidate assertions are mined in the form of frequent patterns in the simulation traces of the system level designs. We consider both cycle accurate and transaction level designs and develop a methodology for the mining of each. For cycle accurate designs, we use both a decision tree based supervised learning algorithms as well as a coverage guided association mining algorithm to search for correlations in the simulation trace. For transaction level designs, sequential pattern mining is applied to generate frequent sequences of function calls and events from traces. We also use a symbolic execution engine to generalize the parameters and return values of the functions to help the data miner find relevant behavior. We show that our technique generates meaningful assertions on both a cycle accurate RISC CPU design and a transaction level AMBA-based DMA controller.","","978-1-4577-0117-7","978-1-4577-0118-4","10.1109/MEMCOD.2011.5970526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5970526","","Algorithm design and analysis;Concrete;Data mining;Data models;Databases;Decision trees;System-level design","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);program verification","DMA controller;RISC CPU design;RTL verification;association mining algorithm;automatic assertion generation engine;automatic generation;candidate assertion;data mining;decision tree;design verification;sequential pattern mining;static analysis;supervised learning;symbolic execution engine;system development;system level design;transaction level designs","","","","2","","25","","","20110801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional very large scale integration design strategies do not exploit this degree of error tolerance and aim to guarantee timing correctness, thereby sacrificing energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose techniques for timing error acceptance to improve the quality-energy tradeoff in image and video processing systems under scaled <formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$V_{DD}$</tex></formula>. The basic philosophy is to prevent signal quality from severe degradation, on average, by using data statistics. The introduced innovations include techniques for carefully controlling possible errors and exploiting the specifics of error patterns for low-cost postprocessing to minimize quality degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on a 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) and a 2-D DCT design. The designs were synthesized using a 45-nm standard cell library, with energy and delay evaluated using NanoSim and VCS. Experiments show that direct applications of controlled error-acceptance techniques allow up to 59% and 71% energy savings by permitting fewer than 1-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) decrease for the 2-D IDCT and DCT designs, respectively. The resulting PSNR remains above 30dB, which is a commonly accepted value for lossy image and video compression. Achieving such energy savings by direct <formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$V_{DD}$</tex></formula> scaling without the proposed transformations results in a 12-dB PSNR loss. The area overhead for the needed control logic is about 4.8% of the original design. To further minimize quality degradation caused by accepted errors in the IDCT, we introduce postfiltering on the output image. The significant improvement of the perceived image quality all- ws further voltage scaling leading to overall energy savings of 70% for the 2-D IDCT, while costing an additional 1.1% in area.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2243658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422364","Error tolerant computing;low energy design","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Delay;Discrete cosine transforms;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","0","","25","","2013-01-28","20130531","","IEEE","IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The SSS2 platform specifies a parametric number of scalar processing elements, based on multiple 32-bit Sparc-compliant engines, augmented with LE2, an ESL-designed 2-way LIW/SIMD accelerator. LE2, which is purely designed in C, exposes a consistent interface to its SIMD datapath directly which is directly derived from the C-source of open-source image processing codes. It is synthesized to Verilog RTL with C2R. Behaviorally-synthesized SIMD datapaths are then 'plugged-in' into the exposed LE2 datapath interface. The LE2 memory interface can be either a cache- based configurable vector load/store unit or a multi-banked, multi-channel streaming local memory system.

Bidirectional approach suffers from motion ambiguity. However, unlike unidirectional approach, bidirectional approach does not suffer from holes and occluded regions. In this article, the particle-based frame rate up conversion algorithm is proposed by combining hierarchical motion vector field construction stage and particle-based motion trajectory calibration stage. First of all, color-oriented adaptive cost function is applied in the hierarchical motion vector field construction stage to retrieve initial motion vectors. Second, the retrieved motion vectors are memorized and calibrated by minimizing the distance between interpolated block and particle trajectory intersecting points. Besides the minimization, joint cost-function evaluation further prevents untrue motion vectors from being selected. According to the experiment results, proposed pixel-based frame rate up conversion outperforms existing works by 0.9-3.9 dB. On the other hand, the computation complexity of proposed work is less than existing bilateral approaches by 5-100, while it is larger than the unidirectional approach by 3-100, according to the target video resolution. This concludes a high visual quality frame rate up conversion design.","1551-319X","","","10.1109/JDT.2012.2186555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198752","Acceleration-based motion trajectory prediction;bidirectional motion estimation;frame rate up conversion;liquid crystal displays (LCDs);pixel-based frame rate up conversion;unidirectional motion estimation","Accuracy;Calibration;Estimation;Motion estimation;Trajectory;Vectors;Video compression","acceleration;calibration;cathode-ray tubes;liquid crystal displays","acceleration assisted motion trajectory calibration;block interpolation;computation complexity;gain 0.9 dB to 3.9 dB;hierarchical motion vector field construction stage;high visual quality particle based frame rate up conversion;joint cost-function evaluation","","","","1","","21","","","20120511","","IEEE","IEEE Broadcast Technology Society;IEEE Components Packaging and Manufacturing Technology Society;IEEE Consumer Electronics Society;IEEE Electron Devices Society;IEEE Industry Applications Society;IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society;IEEE Photonics Society;IEEE Solid State Circuits Society;The Optical Society of America","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With an improper mobility overlap removal, there might be no feasible solutions with resource constraints. In this work, the mobility overlap removal-based method is extended to deal with timing-constrained scheduling problem, where the timing constraint is given as an input and the resource usage should be minimized. A simulated-annealing based method is used to explore the optimal mobility overlap removal. And, given the overlap-free mobilities, a convex-cost flow based algorithm is proposed to schedule single-cycle operations optimally. At the same time, greedy algorithms are devised to schedule multi-cycle operations.

If these two elements are energy-efficient, an energy-efficient power management solution can be obtained. Transaction-level of modelling allows a rapid exploration of different power management solutions, hence a fast decision-making of the most energy-efficient one. The authors' previous work proposed an abstraction of the unified power format (UPF) standard semantics to enable fast evaluation of different UPF-like power architectures at transaction-level (TL). However, a fast evaluation of different power domain management strategies requires a unique and flexible hardware interface to organise transfers of inter-power-domain transactions according to a well-defined protocol. The proposal of a new hardware protocol interface for power domain state management, called power domain management interface (PDMgIF), and its TL simulation model represents the main contribution of this study. This proposal separates functional and power management communications. It represents a potential extension of existing low power standards (such as UPF) that already miss power domain management semantics.The PDMgIF concepts are demonstrated through an audio application TL platform illustrating a high flexibility and reduced overhead of the TL PDMgIF model.","1751-8601","","","10.1049/iet-cdt.2012.0107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562922","","","decision making;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;low-power electronics;power aware computing;protocols;system-on-chip","TL PDMgIF model;TL simulation model;UPF standard semantics;UPF-like power architectures;audio application TL platform;decision making;energy-efficient power management solution;flexible hardware interface;flexible protocol interface;functional management communications;hardware protocol interface;interpower-domain transactions;low power architecture design;power domain management interface;power domain management semantics;power domain state control;power management communications;power management strategy;system-on-chip;transaction-level power domain management;unified power format standard semantics","","","","0","","","","","20130718","","IET","Institution of Engineering and Technology","IET Journals & Magazines"

Debugging the erroneous interactions of events and state in a modern platform when things go wrong is hard enough on a VP; on a real platform (such as an emulator or FPGA-based prototype) it can become impossible unless a new level of sophistication is offered.

To apply the proposed methodology, two kinds of virtual prototypes are distinguished: white-box virtual prototypes composed of open source code Intellectual-Properties (IPs), and black-box ones composed of IPs with limited internal structure observability. In this work, the differences between both cases are delineated. In each case, an implementation method applying the methodology while meeting its requirements is proposed and evaluated.","","978-1-4673-2089-4","978-2-9539987-4-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385398","Energy management;Intellectual property;System-level design;System-on-Chip;Virtual prototyping","Analytical models;Contracts;IP networks;Instruments;Phasor measurement units;Prototypes;Registers","energy management systems;formal verification;industrial property;system-on-chip;virtual prototyping","black box virtual prototypes;early power intent simulation;energy management;internal structure observability;open source code intellectual properties;power features;power-aware verification;system level design;system-on-chip;transaction level virtual prototypes;white box virtual prototypes","","","","0","","13","","","20121220","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simultaneously, the demand for accurate energy estimations on higher abstraction levels is increasing. But estimating energy on these abstraction levels is a difficult task since switching capacitances and area depend on scheduling and allocation decisions which are made during high-level synthesis. In this paper a current energy estimation methodology is extended by a power estimation approach to enable energy-aware design designs on behavioural level. The energy estimation uses control-flow information to model energy and runtime of a component while the power estimation approach generates power and protocol state machines by monitoring external port behaviour and putting it in relation to power dissipation. The methodology is evaluated for a linear predictive coding algorithm receiving its input data from a memory block which is provided as a black-box IP-component. By using the presented estimation methodology, it can be decided at behavioural level whether the usage of this memory element violates a given power budget. The average estimation error for energy is 12.55% while runtime can be estimated with an error of 1.5%.","","","","10.1109/PATMOS.2013.6662155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662155","","Energy consumption;Estimation;IP networks;Logic gates;Runtime;Switches;Vectors","integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated logic circuits","abstraction level;behavioural descriptions;black-box IP-components;control-flow information;digital circuits;energy estimation methodology;energy-aware design decisions;linear predictive coding algorithm;power dissipation;power estimation approach","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that linear system models serve this role for almost all analog circuits, while the variables of these models may be in some transformed domains, rather than being the direct voltage/current waveforms of the circuits. We show how using these models enable new ways to design, optimize, and validate mixed-signal circuits. Even systems that reach steady states only in a stochastic sense can be analyzed as linear systems. Then a remaining issue is to ensure that the non-linear circuit reaches the intended ldquolinearrdquo operating point during start-up, which can be addressed by global convergence analysis.","","978-1-4244-4071-9","978-1-4244-4073-3","10.1109/CICC.2009.5280741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280741","","Analog circuits;Design automation;Design optimization;Digital circuits;Encapsulation;Linear systems;Productivity;Steady-state;Stochastic systems;Voltage","analogue circuits;circuit CAD;digital circuits","Boolean intent leveraging;analog circuits;analog designer productivity;digital circuits;digital designers;direct voltage-current waveforms;global convergence analysis;linear system models;mixed-signal circuits;nonlinear circuit;simpler analog CAD tools","","","","2","","29","","","20091009","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI) has recently released the TLM-2.0 standard for facilitating the interchange of models between suppliers and users, and thus encouraging the use of virtual platforms for fast simulation prior to the availability of register-transfer level (RTL) code. On the other hand, verification of TLM IPs still relies on simulation-based techniques since formal verification methodologies (such as model checking) and tools are not mature enough to be applied at TLM level. In this paper, we propose a methodology to apply existing RTL model checkers for verifying TLM IPs.

This imposes that the development of distinct components cannot be though as affordable for System-on-Chip platforms, whereas a more holistic approach is necessary for deriving optimal solutions. At the same time, the requirement for integrating more functionality in a smaller form factor, or the integration into single chip different technologies (e.g. memory, logic and sensors) pushes traditional semiconductor technology scaling to its limits. Three-dimensional (3-D) chip stacking is touted as the silver bullet technology that can keep Moore's momentum and fuel the next wave of consumer electronic products. Apart from this flexibility, up to now there is a lack of tools, where designers can effectively produce these new platforms. This paper introduces a new design paradigm, named Hybrid Virtual System-on-Chip, in order to support rapid evaluation of different technologies for IC product development. Our framework initiates from SystemC, whereas the target architecture consists of a 3-D chip. Rather than similar approaches which mainly are based on academic tools, the 3-D HVSoCs is evaluated with the usage of Cadence tools.","","978-0-7695-4979-8","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651129","","Computer architecture;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Routing;Software;System-on-chip;Through-silicon vias","consumer electronics;electronic design automation;embedded systems;product development;rapid prototyping (industrial);semiconductor technology;system-on-chip","3D hybrid virtual system-on-chips;HVSoCs;IC product development;Moores momentum;SystemC;consumer electronic products;embedded system;form factor;rapid prototyping;semiconductor technology scaling;silver bullet technology;three-dimensional chip stacking","","","","0","","","","","20131031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although an SDR offers the developer flexibility for software development; porting a waveform application from one SDR to another can be challenging due to variations in requirements, software operating environment (OE), compute resources and hardware design. By asserting that the most effective porting does not begin until an engineering design model (EDM) becomes available means SDR product specific issues may not be uncovered until late in the schedule. However, this risk can be mitigated by inserting advanced hardware/software co-design techniques. In this paper, we will address the technical challenges surrounding the development and porting of waveform software through a virtual radio approach which leverages state-of-the-art virtual platform technology common in commercial system-on-a-chip (SoC) developments.","","978-1-4244-2676-8","978-1-4244-2677-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753431","","Application software;Communication system software;Costs;Design engineering;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Processor scheduling;Programming;Software radio;System-on-a-chip","hardware-software codesign;military communication;operating systems (computers);software radio;software reusability;telecommunication computing","engineering design model;hardware/software co-design techniques;military-based communication programs;software defined radio;software development;software operating environment;state-of-the-art virtual platform;system-on-a-chip developments;virtual radios;waveform porting;waveform software reuse","","","","0","","6","","","20090119","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It requires sophisticated multilevel hierarchies where private and shared caches coexist. It relies on hardware support to implicitly manage relaxed program order and write atomicity so as to provide well-defined shared-memory semantics (captured by the axioms of a memory consistency model) at the hardware-software interface. This paper addresses the problem of checking if an executable representation of the memory system complies with a specified consistency model. Conventional verification techniques encode the axioms as edges of a single directed graph, infer extra edges from memory traces, and indicate an error when a cycle is detected. Unlike them, we propose a novel technique that decomposes the verification problem into multiple instances of an extended bipartite graph matching problem. Since the decomposition was judiciously designed to induce independent instances, the target problem can be solved by a parallel verification algorithm. Our technique, which is proven to be complete for several memory consistency models, outperformed a conventional checker for a suite of 2400 randomly-generated use cases. On average, it found a higher percentage of faults (90%) as compared to that checker (69%) and did it, on average, 272 times faster.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176424","","Algorithm design and analysis;Coherence;Complexity theory;Hardware;Monitoring;Observability;Silicon","directed graphs;formal verification;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","ESL verification;conventional checker;extended bipartite graph matching problem;hardware-software interface;high-end embedded computing;memory consistency;memory consistency model;mobile computing;parallel verification algorithm;private cache;relaxed program order;shared cache;shared-memory semantics;single directed graph;system-on-chip multiprocessing;write atomicity","","","","1","","12","","","20120403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on","September 2013","2013","31","9","1687","1700","In physical-layer security, secret bits are extracted from wireless channels. With the assumption of channel reciprocity, the legitimate users share the same channel which is independent of the channels between the legitimate users and the eavesdropper, leading to secure transmissions. However, practical implementation of the physical layer security faces many challenges. First, for the correlated channel such as the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channel, the security is decreased due to the correlation between the generated secret bits. Second, the nearby eavesdropper posts a security threat due to observing the same channel as the legitimate user's. Third, the eavesdroppers might try to reconstruct the wireless environments. In this paper, we propose two practical physical layer security schemes for the MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems: the precoding matrix index (PMI)-based secret key generation with rotation matrix (MOPRO) and the channel quantization-based (MOCHA) scheme. The former utilizes PMI and rotated reference signals to prevent the eavesdroppers from learning the secret key information and the latter applies channel quantization in order to extract more secret key bits. It is shown that not only the secure communication but also the MIMO gain can be guaranteed by using the proposed schemes.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2013.130904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584930","MIMO-OFDM;Physical-layer security;cryptography;precoding matrix index;secret key generation","Channel estimation;Communication system security;MIMO;Security;Transmitters;Vectors;Wireless communication","MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;correlation methods;matrix algebra;precoding;quantisation (signal);radio transmitters;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MIMO-OFDM channel system;MOCHA;MOPRO;PMI;channel quantization;eavesdropper;multiple-input multiple-output channel;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;practical physical layer security scheme;precoding matrix index;rotation matrix;secret bit extraction;secret key generation;secure transmission;wireless channel reciprocity","","","","0","","","","","20130823","","IEEE","","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence the design method causes high integration costs and redesigns. This paper presents a new design methodology for optimizing avionics architectures at aircraft level. Aircraft level optimization of avionics architectures minimizes cost, weight and cable length, maximizes availability, and generates an XML description of the optimized IMA architecture. A behavioral model of an avionics system is automatically mapped into this optimized architecture. The combined model of architecture and functional behavior is analyzed. For an example system it is shown that this aircraft level optimization methodology can reduce cable/length/weight by 68% and increase availability by several orders of magnitude over a conventional design.","","978-1-4244-2207-4","978-1-4244-2208-1","10.1109/DASC.2008.4702754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4702754","","Aerospace electronics;Aircraft;Cost function;Design methodology;Design optimization;Mobile robots;Process design;Remotely operated vehicles;Space vehicles;Uncertainty","XML;avionics;computer architecture;optimisation","XML description;aircraft level optimization;avionics architectures;cable length;complex system design partition;cost minimization;design methodology;functional behavior","","","","2","","13","","","20081209","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their efficient configuration and management in mobile environment is not obvious. In this paper, a SystemC model of a multi-channel memory is constructed out of low-power double data rate SDRAMs. The model is simulated with sketchy load in order to gain understanding how memory access size and number of channels affect access times and power figures. The simulations confirm that applications with large data accesses benefit from the multi-channel memories. When used properly, multi-channel memories provide the capability for high throughput but do not introduce excessive overhead compared to single-channel memories in terms of energy consumption. The experiments also reveal that relatively small accesses can be extremely expensive if the memory is not properly configured. In future systems, novel policies, advanced control mechanisms, and reorganization of traditional memory management are needed to keep the power consumption manageable.","","978-1-4244-4465-6","978-1-4244-4467-0","10.1109/SOCC.2009.5335661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335661","","Energy consumption;Energy management;Environmental management;Load modeling;Performance analysis;Power system management;Power system modeling;Random access memory;Throughput;Video recording","DRAM chips;energy consumption;high level languages;low-power electronics;mobile communication","SystemC model;double data rate SDRAM;energy consumption;low-power SDRAM;memory access size;memory loads;memory management;mobile devices;multichannel memory;performance analysis","","","","1","","10","","","20091113","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The function of edge detection is to identify the boundaries of homogeneous regions in an image based on properties such as intensity and texture. The morphological filter is used as an initial process in edge detection for noisy images where “opening-closing” operations are used to filter noise thus enhancing edge detection performance. In this paper we study the additional cost in resources caused by implementing the morphological filter prior to edge detection, area, power and energy consumption are considered, the cost is a major factor in determining to use or not the morphological filter in a particular application. To achieve this estimation we used a high level estimation tool, high level design and estimation is gaining ground as it allows design decisions in an early stages of development therefore reducing costs, these tools are also gaining in accuracy. We used morphological filter as a preprocessing stage for the Shen-Castan edge detector. Starting C code the high level estimation tool produces RTL level circuits and using power and energy consumption models based on a hardware database (generic ASIC in our case) it produces reports about Area, Power and Energy consumption, an estimation of performance is also possible.","","978-1-4244-7532-2","","10.1109/SSD.2010.5585562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585562","ASIC;High Level energy estimation;PowerOpt Tool;Shen-Castan edge detector;morphological filter","Filtering algorithms;Hardware;Image edge detection;Laplace equations","edge detection;energy consumption;filtering theory","Shen-Castan edge detector;edge detection;energy consumption;high level estimation;image information;image processing;implementation cost;morphological filter;power consumption models","","","","0","","10","","","20100927","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a unified and integrated HLS framework, to automatically produce custom and massively-parallel hardware, including its memory and system interfaces from high-level sequential program code. Using compiler-generators and logic programming techniques, provably-correct hardware compilation flow is achieved. The utilized hardware optimization inference engine is driven by a set of resource constraints, which limit to a certain boundary the number of available hardware operators to function in parallel during each control step. This optimization reduces drastically the number of different control steps (states) of the implemented application. The hardware compilation runs are completed in orders-of-magnitude less time than that which would be needed by even very experienced HDL designers to implement the same applications in RTL code. Implementation results from synthesis of a number of control-dominated, linear and repetitive, applications including a MPEG video compression engine with up to a few hundred states, are presented. In all cases the HLS framework delivers quickly provably-correct, implementable RTL code and the optimized schedule is reduced at up to 30% in comparison with the initial schedule.","","978-1-4244-7321-2","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571800","E-CAD;ESL;FSM;High-Level Synthesis;compilers","Algorithms;Benchmark testing;Engines;Hardware;Program processors;Schedules;Transform coding","high level synthesis;logic programming;parallel processing","MPEG video compression engine;automatic generation;compiler generators;complex IC systems;control-intensive sequential programs;hardware optimization inference engine;high-level sequential program code;high-level synthesis;integrated HLS framework;logic programming;massively parallel hardware;provably-correct hardware compilation flow","","","","0","","19","","","20100916","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

System design often starts in a high abstraction level, by developing a virtual platform (VP), which is typically composed of TLM models. TLM has become very popular in the modeling of bus-based systems and currently there is an increasing availability of libraries that provide TLM IPs. Heterogeneity can be naturally captured in a framework supporting different Models of Computation (MoCs). We introduce a novel approach for integrating TLM IPs/VPs into a MoC-based modeling framework, allowing them to co-simulate heterogeneous systems. This approach allows to raise the abstraction level, enabling a more careful design space exploration before selecting a proper VP.

For instance, the applications evolved to the point that in many cases hard-real-time execution on multiprocessor platforms is needed in order to meet the applications' timing requirements. Moreover, in some cases, there is a need to run a set of such applications simultaneously on the same platform with support for accepting new incoming applications at run-time. Dealing with all these new challenges increases significantly the complexity of system design. However, the design time must remain acceptable. This requires the development of novel systematic and automated design methodologies driven by the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose such a novel methodology for automated design of an embedded multiprocessor system, which can run multiple hard-real-time streaming applications simultaneously. Our methodology does not need the complex and time-consuming design space exploration phase, present in most of the current state-of-the art multiprocessor design frameworks. In contrast, our methodology applies very fast yet accurate schedulability analysis to determine the minimum number of processors, needed to schedule the applications, and the mapping of applications' tasks to processors. Furthermore, our methodology enables the use of hard-real-time multiprocessor scheduling theory to schedule the applications in a way that temporal isolation and a given throughput of each application are guaranteed. We evaluate an implementation of our methodology using a set of real-life streaming applications and demonstrate that it can greatly reduce the design time and effort while generating high quality hard-real-time systems.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176632","","Algorithm design and analysis;Design methodology;Processor scheduling;Production;Program processors;Schedules;Timing","computational complexity;electronic design automation;embedded systems;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","application timing requirements;embedded multiprocessor system;hard-real-time embedded streaming systems automated design;hard-real-time multiprocessor scheduling theory;schedulability analysis;state-of-the art multiprocessor design frameworks;system design complexity;time-consuming design space exploration phase","","","","0","","18","","","20120403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such expedients might result in false positives (or negatives), affecting both the checker's effort and effectiveness. By relying on established guarantees for postmortem checkers, this paper proves that relaxed scoreboards can be built with full verification guarantees, as far as they employ an update rule based on the removal of dominators.

Starting with a variants system specification including a set of task graphs, linear constraints on binary variables are specified for their alternative selection as well as the selection of groups of alternatives called application groups. These constraints may stem from a certain domain knowledge, e. g., entertainment or power train domain, or global constraints. The typically vast space of resulting possible combinations of different selections of alternative behaviors will be termed variant space and those satisfying the set of formulated constraints valid variants. An important result of this paper is that the set of variants, and especially the set of valid variants, do not need to be modeled or stored explicitly but rather implicitly. Nevertheless do we show that using state-of-the-art PB solver techniques, we may determine the set of valid variants very efficiently. Each of these valid variants may subsequently be used as a candidate for design space exploration (DSE) in order to optimize also the mapping of the corresponding task graph functionalities to a final optimized E/E architecture. A real-world case study is provided to demonstrate the capabilities and efficiency of the presented approach on implicit variant modeling and analysis.","","","","10.1109/CODES-ISSS.2013.6659011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6659011","","Automotive engineering;Business;Computer architecture;Hardware;Sensors;Software;Space exploration","automotive electronics;design engineering;embedded systems;graph theory;mechanical engineering computing","DSE;IVaM;PB solver techniques;automotive embedded systems;design space exploration;electric-and-electronic architecture functionality;electronic control units;functional variant analysis;functional variant modeling;global business knowledge;graph-based approach;group selection;implicit variant modeling-and-management;linear constraints;local technical expert knowledge;task graph functionalities","","","","0","","","","","20131111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low power is generally critical due to its impact on lifetime, battery longevity, battery capacity, temperature constraints, etc. Unfortunately, when a designer needs some power estimations about its design, the methods and tools which can help him are not sufficient. Indeed, there is a lack of efficient methodology and accurate tool to obtain power/energy estimation of a complete system at different abstraction levels. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a global framework for power/energy estimation and optimization of heterogeneous MultiProcessor System on Chip (MPSoC). This framework supports both a power modeling methodology and a power platform estimations which can help the designer to choose the best solution for his design. The methodology supported takes into account all the embedded system's relevant aspects; the software, the hardware, and the operating system. It includes several estimation tools with respect to their abstraction levels in order to cover the overall design flow. Starting from functional estimation and down to real boards measurements, our platform helps designers to develop new power models, to explore new architectures, and to apply optimization techniques in order to reduce energy and power consumption of the system. The usefulness and the effectiveness of the proposed power estimation framework are demonstrated through a typical embedded system conceived around the Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform.","","978-1-4673-2498-4","","10.1109/DSD.2012.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386956","Low Power System-on-Chip Design;Performance Optimization;Power and Energy Estimations","Embedded systems;Estimation;Hardware;Optimization;Power demand;Program processors","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;low-power electronics;multiprocessing systems;optimisation;system-on-chip","MPSoC optimization;Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform;abstraction levels;battery capacity;battery longevity;electronic corporations;energy optimization platform;low power complex embedded systems;multiprocessor system on chip ptimization;open power platform;open-people;operating system;power consumption;power modeling methodology;power-energy estimation;temperature constraints","","","","0","","22","","","20121231","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, fabrication technology can not cover this demand with frequency increase and dimension shrinking only, as it has been done in the past. New architectural level innovations are needed, like reconfigurable computing. Reconfigurable computing takes advantage of idle components or shared functionality between different algorithms, to maximize utilization and improve performance, based on efficient circuit switching interconnections. However, dense and switching interconnections bring power dissipation problems, which are more clear in the deep submicron domain.

As one of the goals of high level modeling is to part communication from computation, synthesizing communication mechanisms including sockets can be a primary step to synthesize each TLM 2.0 design on RTL. Synthesizing sockets on RTL can provide the designer with the big picture of module's functionality and communication requirements. In this paper, algorithms are proposed to map TLM 2.0 simple sockets down to RTL focusing on TLM 2.0 blocking and non-blocking transport interfaces. The algorithms get TLM 2.0 sockets as an input and generate an intermediate description of sockets in terms of ports. After that, RTL descriptions of the ports are generated using the standard generic payload packet as transaction type.

Besides the needs for merging more functionality, more and more enhancements are for the purpose of interface upgrading for new standards and better or faster signal processing hardware engines for video/audio encoding and decoding. Physical designs for these kinds of enhanced chips can reuse large potions of the previous layout and do not need to be re-implemented from the ground up to shorten the time to market. However, traditional physical incremental design method is becoming impractical, especially for the flat design, which usually can has the advantage of the smaller die size compared with the hierarchical design. In this paper, we propose an incremental physical design method to take the advantages of the hieratical design while maintaining the cost strength in the flat design. Our proposed method has been successfully applied to our next generation multimedia chip and the results show that no design iteration is needed and the run time is at least 5 times faster compared with the traditional method.","","978-1-4244-2781-9","978-1-4244-2782-6","10.1109/VDAT.2009.5158167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5158167","","Consumer electronics;Costs;Decoding;Design methodology;Encoding;Engines;Hardware;Merging;Time to market;Video signal processing","consumer electronics;logic design;system-on-chip","consumer electronic;decoding;flat SoC design;incremental physical design method;next generation multimedia chip;signal processing hardware engine;system-on-chip;video-audio encoding","","","","0","","11","","","20090707","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, traditional hardware description languages (HDL), e.g., Verilog and VHDL, which are used by hardware designers to describe the hardware and model the hardware in a detailed simulated environment, are not appropriate for the purpose of HW/SW co-design. Instead, SystemC provides a higher-level simulation environment to the developers and is more suitable for HW/SW co-design. Furthermore, HDL-based simulation environments are far too slow to execute parallel programs as the number of processor cores increases. Thus, one would have liked an automated tool for converting existing HDL-based chip designs to SystemC or even higher-level functional descriptions so that the simulation speed would be acceptable for multicore systems. However, since existing tools failed to accomplish that, we developed an automated tool, called V2X, to convert Verilog chip designs to SystemC. In this paper, we show that complicated Verilog-based multicore chip descriptions were translated into SystemC descriptions automatically and resulted in better performance and programmability. In our case study, V2X successfully translated the 8-core OpenSPARC T1 system-on-chip into SystemC. Without further abstraction, the simulation speed was improved by ~40 times. The two-stage translation scheme makes V2X flexible and extensible, which paves the way for further abstraction to speed up the simulation environment.","","978-1-4244-8095-1","978-0-7695-4190-7","10.1109/ISPA.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5634361","Multicore;SystemC;Systems-on-Chips;Verilog;system-level simulation;translator","Hardware;Hardware design languages;IP networks;Load modeling;Semantics;Software;Syntactics","digital simulation;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","SystemC-based simulation environment;V2X automated tool;Verilog-based multicore chip;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;multicore system-on-chip","","","","1","","20","","","20101111","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, energy-scalability is introduced in the SDR design. Secondly, intelligent run-time cross-layer control is introduced to enable low power operation, by exploiting this scalability as well as the dynamics in the system. As a result, SDRs can be realized achieving a power consumption which can be comparable with dedicated radios, both in standby/idle mode or when transmitting or receiving data.

This allows comparison data generated by FSV to be compared with equivalent “visual” comparisons obtained using the visual rating scale. Previous research has shown a close relationship between visual assessment and FSV generated data using the resulting confidence histograms. In all cases, the category membership functions are “crisp”: that is data on the FSV value axis fall distinctly into one category. An important open question in FSV-based research, and for validation techniques generally, is whether allowed variability in these crisp category membership functions could further improve agreement with the visual assessment. A similar and related question is how robust is FSV to variation in the categorization algorithm. This paper and its associated “part II” present research aimed at developing a better understanding of the categorization of both visual and FSV data using nonsquare or variable boundary category membership functions. This first paper investigates the level of improvement to be expected by applying fuzzy logic to location of the category boundaries.

In this paper, we present PowerSUNSHINE, a power- and energy-estimation tool that fills the void. PowerSUNSHINE is the first scalable power/energy estimation tool for WSNs that provides an accurate prediction for both fixed and flexible sensor nodes. In this paper, we first describe requirements and challenges of building PowerSUNSHINE. Then, we present power/energy models for both fixed and flexible sensor nodes. Two testbeds, a MicaZ platform and a flexible node consisting of a microcontroller, a radio and a FPGA based co-processor, are provided to demonstrate the simulation fidelity of PowerSUNSHINE. We also discuss several evaluation results based on simulation and testbeds to show that PowerSUNSHINE is a scalable simulation tool that provides accurate estimation of power/energy consumption for both fixed and flexible sensor nodes.","2155-5486","978-1-4673-1904-1","978-1-4673-1903-4","10.1109/SECON.2012.6275767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275767","","Current measurement;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Microcontrollers;Power demand;Wireless sensor networks","field programmable gate arrays;microcontrollers;wireless sensor networks","FPGA based coprocessor;MicaZ platform;PowerSUN-SHINE;WSN;energy consumption;energy-estimation tool;field-programmable gate arrays;fixed sensor nodes;flexible hardware;flexible sensor nodes;microcontroller;power-energy consumption;power-energy models;power-estimation tool;programmable hardware components;real-time performance;sensor nodes;simulation environments;wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","27","","","20120823","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, fast MPSoC virtual platforms which support fully functional execution of software with good timing accuracy are required.

SUNSHINE solves several sensornet simulation challenges, including data exchanges and time synchronizations across different simulation domains and simulation accuracy levels. SUNSHINE also provides hardware specification scheme for simulating flexible and customized hardware designs. Several experiments are given to illustrate SUNSHINE's simulation capability.

Modern wireless communication standards involve large complexity and highly-multirate behavior, and typically result in long simulation time. The traditional approach for simulating SDF graphs is to compute and execute static single-processor schedules. Nowadays, multi-core processors are increasingly popular for their potential performance improvements through on-chip, thread-level parallelism. However, without novel scheduling and simulation techniques that explicitly explore multithreading capability, current design tools gain only minimal performance improvements. In this paper, we present a new multithreaded simulation scheduler, called MSS, to provide simulation runtime speed-up for executing SDF graphs on multi-core processors. We have implemented MSS in the advanced design system (ADS) from Agilent Technologies. On an Intel dual-core, hyper-threading (4 processing units) processor, our results from this implementation demonstrate up to 3.5 times speed-up in simulating modern wireless communication systems (e.g., WCDMA3G, CDMA 2000, WiMax, EDGE, and Digital TV).","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555833","Multithreaded simulation;Scheduling;Synchronous dataflow","Communication standards;Computational modeling;Multiaccess communication;Multicore processing;Multithreading;Parallel processing;Performance gain;Processor scheduling;Runtime;Wireless communication","processor scheduling;radio networks","advanced design system;multicore processors;multithreaded simulation scheduler;synchronous dataflow graphs;wireless communication systems","","","","1","","","","","20080702","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, there is a very large spectrum of interconnection topologies that potentially meet given communication requirements, determining various trade-offs between cost and performance. This work proposes an automated methodology to choose among all of these possibilities, avoiding a manual and time consuming design space search process. The methodology takes as input the description of the application communication requirements, and gives as output an on-chip synthesizable interconnection structure satisfying given area constraints. Targeted at FPGA technologies, the approach generates an interconnection structure combining crossbars and shared buses, connected through bridges, yielding a scalable, efficient structure. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it provides the first method to automatically generate FPGA-based communication architectures where heterogeneous communication elements, such as shared buses and crossbar switches, coexist in a network inherently supporting multiple communication paths. The resulting architecture improves the level of communication parallelism that can be exploited, while keeping area requirements low. The paper thoroughly describes the formalisms and the methodology used to derive such optimized heterogeneous topologies. It also discusses a couple of case-study applications emphasizing the impact of the proposed approach and highlighting the essential differences with a few other solutions in the literature.","","","","10.1109/FPL.2013.6645494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645494","","Bridges;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Parallel processing;System-on-chip;Topology","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit interconnections;network topology;system-on-chip","FPGA-based heterogeneous interconnect topologies;automated synthesis;communication topology;intercomponent data traffic;interconnection topologies;space search process","","","","0","","","","","20131024","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, transactors implementation and verification are duty of designers so far and their generation effort often overcomes the benefits of the TLM-based design adoption. In this paper a methodology is proposed to automate some parts of the transactor generation aiming at reaching their correct-by-construction implementation.

However, widespread usage of FPGAs has been limited by increased design complexity. Highlevel synthesis has reduced this complexity but often relies on inaccurate software simulation or lengthy register-transfer-level simulations for verification and debugging, which is unattractive to software developers. In this paper, we present high-level synthesis techniques that allow application designers to efficiently synthesize ANSI-C assertions into FPGA circuits, enabling real-time verification and debugging of circuits generated from highlevel languages, while executing in the actual FPGA environment. Although not appropriate for all systems (e.g., safety-critical systems), the proposed techniques enable software developers to rapidly verify and debug FPGA applications, while reducing frequency by less than 3% and increasing FPGA resource utilization by less than 0.13% for several application case studies on an Altera Stratix-II EP2S180 using Impulse-C. The presented techniques reduced area overhead by as much as 3x and improved assertion performance by as much as 100% compared to unoptimized in-circuit assertions.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470747","","Application software;Circuit simulation;Circuit synthesis;Computational modeling;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Field programmable gate arrays;High level synthesis;High performance computing;Software debugging","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;high level synthesis;program debugging;program verification","Altera Stratix-II EP2S180;FPGA;debug;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;high level synthesis techniques;high performance computing;incircuit assertion based verification;microprocessors;safety critical systems;software developers","","","","1","","18","","","20100524","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first axiomatization uses an algebra of operations on bit-vectors. The second axiomatization considers a bit-vector as a unary relation and memory as a relation of larger arity. For some designs, including real-life designs, the second axiomatization results in a first-order problem falling into a known decidable fragment of first-order logic and suitable for solving by modern first-order provers.

In the presence of process variations, worst-case timing analysis may lead to overly conservative synthesis, and may end up using excess resources to guarantee design constraints. In this paper, we propose an efficient variation-aware resource sharing and binding algorithm in behavioral synthesis, which takes into account the performance variations for functional units. The performance yield, which is defined as the probability that the synthesized hardware meets the target performance constraints, is used to evaluate the synthesis result. An efficient metric called statistical performance improvement, is used to guide resource sharing and binding. The proposed algorithm is evaluated within a commercial synthesis framework that generates optimized RTL netlists from behavioral specifications. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated with a set of industrial benchmark designs, which consist of blocks that are commonly used in wireless and image processing applications. The experimental results show that our method achieves an average 33% area reduction over traditional methods, which are based on the worst-case delay analysis, with an average 10% run time overhead.","","978-1-4244-2748-2","978-1-4244-2749-9","10.1109/ASPDAC.2009.4796445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796445","","Delay;Graphics;Hardware;High level synthesis;Partitioning algorithms;Performance analysis;Resource management;Timing;Transistors;Uncertainty","circuit CAD;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design","behavioral synthesis;delay uncertainty;hand coded register-transfer level;statistical performance improvement;submicron designs;variation-aware resource binding;variation-aware resource sharing","","","","3","","26","","","20090227","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This creates demand for system level computer-aided-design (CAD) tools that allow early hardware and software co-development, hardware and software performance evaluation and fast system-level modeling. The latest achievements in this area are mostly due to wide SystemC adoption and the recent introduction of the TLM 2.0 standard. The complexity of today's SoC designs makes high-level synthesis (HLS) an important part of modern design flows. In this paper, we analyze two basic approaches to HLS user input that exist today sequential ANSI C/C++ and SystemC synthesizable subset. Based upon the results of our analysis, we propose a new concept SystemC synthesizable superset a solution that combines advantages of both approaches (ANSI C/C++ and SystemC), but does not inherit their disadvantages. Our HLS-oriented concept features a predefined library of HLS modules, user threads with implicit timing specification and a set of TLM 2.0 compatible interfaces. In addition, our HLS objects allow for various levels of simulation abstraction (or timing accuracy), such as cycle-accurate at transaction boundaries (CATB), approximately-timed and loosely-timed modeling. Simulation abstraction levels can be switched without the need to rewrite the user system specification that determines high flexibility level of our solution.

The proposed architecture performs intra prediction and inter prediction with our rate control mechanism in the first two stages. In addition, a low complexity macroblock (MB)-level mean absolute difference (MAD) prediction algorithm which considers both the motion information and the MAD value in the neighboring and current MBs is proposed.

Power consumption is as important as performance in battery-powered embedded systems and in future, embedded processors are to process more computation-intensive applications with limited power budgets. Therefore, power consumption of theses processors will become more critical. According to the high contribution of memory access power in total power consumption of embedded systems, memory architecture of embedded systems strongly influences the system design objectives. Cache memories are usually used to improve the performance and power consumption by bridging the gap between the speed and power consumption of the main memory and CPU, therefore, the system performance and power consumption is severely related to the average memory access time and power consumption which makes the cache architecture as a major concern in designing embedded processors. Therefore, the embedded system designer requires a comprehensive design space exploration for memory architecture. In this paper we explore the design space of cache in embedded processors to find out the cache sizes which have the optimum performance/power consumption in embedded applications.","","978-1-4577-2058-1","","10.1109/ICCAIE.2011.6162098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162098","Embedded processor;cache;design space exploration;optimum size;power consumption;power per performance","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Embedded systems;Energy consumption;Power demand;Program processors;Space exploration","cache storage;design engineering;memory architecture;power aware computing","battery-powered embedded systems;cache architecture;cache memories;cache power;computation-intensive applications;embedded applications;embedded processor design;memory access power;memory access time;memory architecture comprehensive design space exploration;performance tradeoffs;power budgets;power consumption","","","","2","","28","","","20120301","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Physical planning of three-dimensional integrated circuits is substantially different from that of traditional planar integrated circuits, due to the presence of multiple layers of dies. To realize the full potential offered by three-dimensional integration, it is necessary to take physical information into consideration at higher-levels of the design abstraction for 3D ICs. This paper proposes an incremental system-level synthesis framework that tightly integrates behavioral synthesis of modules into the layer assignment and floorplan- ning stage of 3D IC design. Behavioral synthesis is implemented as a sub-routine to be called to adjust delay/power/variability/area of circuit modules during the physical planning process. Experimental results show that with the proposed synthesis-during-planning methodology, the overall timing yield is improved by 8%, and the chip peak temperature reduced by 6.6°C, compared to the conventional planning-after-synthesis approach.","1530-1591","978-1-4577-2145-8","","10.1109/DATE.2012.6176673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176673","","Delay;Integrated circuits;Lead;Three dimensional displays","CMOS integrated circuits;high level synthesis;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit layout;nanoelectronics;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D IC design;3D high level synthesis;3DHLS;area adjustment;behavioral synthesis;circuit modules;delay adjustment;design abstraction;floorplanning;incremental system-level synthesis framework;layer assignment;multiple die layers;nanometer-scale CMOS interconnects;physical planning process;power adjustment;synthesis-during-planning methodology;three-dimensional IC;three-dimensional circuit integration;three-dimensional integrated circuit planning;variability adjustment","","","","0","","16","","","20120403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

An on-chip communication library is developed for practical parallel applications. In addition, we propose two memory-based file handling approaches to manipulate files with the lack of file-system support by OS. Our file handling approach can effectively reduce the minimum requirement of local memory without page swapping for each core from 4 MB to 64 KB in a case study of JPEG encoding. Furthermore, the analysis of instruction and data caches is addressed for the trade-off between area and speed.

We developed a tool, simulate and eliminate (S&E), that is fundamentally different from the existing high-level design tools as it employs a top-to-bottom methodology. S&E provides automatic generation of a variety of general purpose processing cores with different parameterization options. Then, the provided application(s) are simulated on this general-purpose architecture and the unneeded functionality is eliminated resulting in application specific architecture.

This concept implies a consumer-oriented industry driven by software from the top, and enabled (and constrained) by nano-scale physics at the atomic level. ""More-Moore"" will be needed to deliver the giga-ops computation and GHz communication capabilities required for stationary and wearable devices. But AmI also creates new challenges at the architectural and physical levels. To make AmI possible, AmI devices need two-orders-of-magnitude-lower power dissipation than today's microprocessors, at one-twentieth of the cost. These requirements conflict with the embedded programmability needed for personalization and adaptation to new services. We focus on emerging techniques for bridging this gap between software-centric systems and power-efficient platform architectures for AmI devices. A second challenge is to cope with the fact that nano-scale physical phenomena are in conflict with the traditional ""nice and predictable"" digital abstractions now used for complexity management. Techniques for coping with uncertainty and signal degradation, while achieving better-than-worst-case design, are discussed. Finally, one must realize that, to facilitate AmI, ""more-than-Moore"" technology is required, for example, for the design of autonomous wireless sensor networks.

To improve the video decoding performance by using the multiple cores, one of parallel algorithms should be adopted. However, different parallel algorithm should be selected for different video standard on different platform. Therefore, an engine to estimate performance on a target platform from existing single-thread video decoder is very helpful. This paper proposes a Multi-core Video decoder System level analytics Engine (MVSE) to estimate the performance on a target multi-core platform. In the MVSE, a general video decoder runs according to profiling data and macroblock information by three major parallel algorithms. The profiling data and macroblock information are obtained from existing single-thread video decoder so that the MVSE can support different video standard. The MVSE runs on target platform to consider the effect of memory access contention and cache intercommunication, which are traditionally difficult to estimate. Our experimental result shows the MVSE estimation is accuracy enough. The estimation results from MVSE shows the best speedup ratio is 1.7 times in a dual-core platform and 2.9 times in a quad-core platform for H.264 720p decoding. In addition, MVSE is also helpful for hardware and software co-design in heterogeneous computing. The experimental results show the best performance is improved by VLD hardware, and the speedup ratio is 2.3 times in a dual-core platform and 3.9 times in a quad-core platform.","","978-1-4673-4435-7","","10.1109/VLDI-DAT.2013.6533859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6533859","","","data compression;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips;video coding","H.264 720p decoding;MVSE estimation;cache intercommunication;dual-core platform;hand-held embedded systems;hardware codesign;macroblock information;memory access contention;multicore video decoder system level analytics engine;multiple cores;parallel algorithms;quadcore platform;single-thread video decoder;software codesign","","","","0","","9","","","20130617","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, communications over wideband MSML channels are considered, where conventional communication methods often fail. A new parameterized data model is proposed, where the continuous MSML channel is approximated by discrete channel coefficients. It is argued that this parameterized data model is always subject to discretization errors in the baseband. However, by designing the transmit/receive pulse intelligently and imposing a multi-branch structure on the receiver, one can eliminate the impact of the discretization errors on equalization. In addition, to enhance the bandwidth efficiency, a novel multi-layer transmit signaling is proposed, which is characterized by multiple data rates on different layers. The inter-layer interference, induced by the multi-layer transmitter, can also be minimized by the same design of the transmit/receive pulse. As a result, the effective channel experienced by the receiver can be described by a block diagonal matrix, with each diagonal block being strictly banded. Such a channel matrix structure enables the use of several existing low-complexity equalizers viable.","1053-587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2230169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365356","Equalization;multi-rate transmission;underwater communications;wideband time-varying channels","Baseband;Data models;OFDM;Passband;Receivers;Wideband","equalisers;interference (signal);matrix algebra;time-varying channels;underwater acoustic communication","LTV channels;bandwidth-carrier-frequency ratio;block diagonal matrix;channel matrix structure;communication methods;continuous MSML channel;discrete channel coefficients;discretization errors;interlayer interference;linear time-varying channel;low-complexity equalizers;multibranch structure;multilayer transmit signaling;multilayer transmitter;multirate block transmission;parameterized data model;receiver;transmit-receive pulse;underwater acoustic communications;wideband MSML channels;wideband multiscale multilag channels;wideband transmissions","","","","4","","34","","2012-11-29","20130125","","IEEE","IEEE Signal Processing Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Development of specialized FPGA solutions for object detection and tracking using a hardware-description language is time consuming and requires deep knowledge of the target system. Using SystemC, a C++ based class library, fast implementation with less knowledge of the system is possible. However, the gain in development speed is accompanied by higher resource usage of the FPGA and lower performance regarding computation speed. In this paper, several image processing algorithms are implemented in both manners and are compared regarding achievable update-rate, resource consumption and development time. The SystemC implementations could be implemented twice as fast and with less knowledge about the system.

The standard practice is to translate a subset of IPs at a time and cosimulate with the rest of the system to validate the translated IPs. Hence, this paper explores scenarios that affect the cosimulation performance. Varying cosimulation scenarios affect the performance upto 30%.

By observing only a subset of output responses, this method can effectively deal with all the above-mentioned problems. Efficient algorithms that can identify near optimum subsets of output bits to cover all detectable faults in very large circuits are developed. Experimental results show that less than 10% of the output response bits of an already very compact test set are enough to achieve 100% single stuck-at fault coverage for most ISCAS benchmark circuits. Even better results are obtained for ITC 99 benchmark circuits as less than 3% of output bits are enough to cover all stuck-at faults in these circuits. The increase ratio of selected bits to cover other types of faults is shown to be quite small if these faults are taken into account during automatic test pattern generation.

Thus, designers have to look at Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based development techniques that rely on integrating components produced by various manufacturers. However, the vast range of components from various manufacturers leads to obscurity of interfaces between them, making system integration a dreadful task. Hence, large warehouses of IP modules comprising of various software simulation models of system components at different levels of abstraction that can be readily integrated to form a Virtual Prototype are highly beneficial towards the exploration of various architectures. In order to design and implement IP modules efficiently, we identify the Design patterns that they follow. We propose a Design pattern based methodology for modeling and implementing multiplexed Master-Slave devices. As an effort to showcase the methodology, we choose to model a Level-2 Cache (L2Cache) using SystemC. A technical specification document of the Motorola MPC2605 L2Cache is procured and modeled using hierarchical state machines that we implement using SystemC. The developed model is an integrated lookaside L2Cache supporting 4-way set-associative cache mapping and LRU replacement algorithm, compatible with the Simple Bus. The L2Cache module is then further parameterized to accommodate changes in L2Cache size, cache mapping strategies and replacement algorithms. In this paper, we present the proposed methodology through a description of the process of modeling and verifying an L2Cache IP module at system-level, using the “Master-Bus-Slave/Master-Bus-Slave” Design pattern. The test-bench involves a master (to generate transactions), a Simple Bus, the L2Cache Module and Slave Module (Simple memory). Various relevant test cases were generated to test the functionality of the developed module. The test-case outputs were routed to a debug file - - which is inspected to determine whether the output is as expected. We conclude by enunciating our learning from our experience with this methodology.","","978-1-4244-9178-0","978-1-4244-9176-6","10.1109/NESEA.2010.5678054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678054","Design Patterns;ESL;L2Cache;SystemC;TLM","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;IP networks;Multiplexing;Object oriented modeling;Program processors;Random access memory","cache storage;formal specification","LRU replacement algorithm;Motorola MPC2605 L2Cache;SystemC;commercial-off-the-shelf based development;hierarchical state machines;level-2 cache IP module;multiplexed master-slave device;pattern based methodology;set-associative cache mapping;software simulation models;technical specification document;virtual prototype","","","","0","","7","","","20101230","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Symposium on","13-16 Nov. 2006","2006","","","1","4","The growing complexity of electronic systems has forced the adoption of new design methods operating on higher abstraction levels. These new methods include for example the utilization of virtual platforms in software development, the early exploration of architectures, management of platform complexity, system-level verification, and high-level synthesis of sub-modules of a system. In this paper, some of the issues encountered in adopting these design methods into production use are discussed. Based on the experiences gathered, it seems that the methods are still somewhat immature and, frequently, based on proprietary technologies. This calls for a unified effort from the design community to come into an agreement on the details of the methods and, consequently, drive these agreements into truly open standard solutions. From system house perspective, this is the only way these new design methods can be successful.

The absence of principled support for system evaluation and optimization at high abstraction levels makes the quality of the resulting implementation highly dependent on the experience or prejudices of the designer. In this work we present TURNUS, a unified dataflow design space exploration framework for heterogeneous parallel systems. It provides high-level modelling and simulation methods and tools for system level performances estimation and optimization. TURNUS represents the outcome of several years of research in the area of co-design exploration for multimedia stream applications. During the presentation, it will be demonstrated how the initial high-level abstraction of the design facilitates the use of different analysis and optimization heuristics. These guide the designer during validation and optimization stages without requiring low-level implementations of parts of the application. Our framework currently yields exploration and optimization results in terms of algorithmic optimization, rapid performance estimation, application throughput, buffer size dimensioning, and power optimization.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661566","co-exploration;dataflow;design space","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Educational institutions;Multimedia communication;Optimization;Space exploration;Streaming media","data flow computing;media streaming;multiprocessing programs;program compilers","RVC-CAL applications;TURNUS framework;algorithmic optimization;analysis heuristic;application throughput;buffer size dimensioning;codesign exploration;heterogeneous concurrent system design;heterogeneous parallel systems;high abstraction levels;high-level modelling;multimedia stream applications;optimization heuristic;optimization stage;power optimization;rapid performance estimation;simulation methods;system evaluation;system level performances estimation;system optimization;unified dataflow design space exploration framework;validation stage","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tools and methods used when designing dynamically reconfigurable systems are influenced by the target application domain. In this tutorial, it is assumed that the application is an embedded processor system implemented in a single platform FPGA. Dynamic reconfiguration will be used to time-multiplex mutually exclusive sub-components in the system architecture that are used periodically. Simulating dynamically reconfigurable systems in RTL simulators has been investigated but RTL simulators normally do not allow the topology of the system architecture to change during simulation. 'Virtual multiplexors', placed at subcomponent I/O interfaces, determine which sub-component receives input and generates output. A reconfiguration controller switches the virtual multiplexors according to a given reconfiguration schedule or algorithm. The design of a dynamical and partial hardware reconfigurable system is however still not sufficient supported by design tools. To accomplish this, the signal lines for communication with the functionality in the reconfigurable area must be placed at a known position, which can be done by using so called macros","","0-7803-9264-7","","10.1109/SOCC.2005.1554518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1554518","","Field programmable gate arrays;Instruments","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;reconfigurable architectures","RTL simulators;dynamically reconfigurable application;embedded processor system;field programmable gate arrays;reconfiguration controller;single platform FPGA;virtual multiplexors","","","","1","","8","","","20051212","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Abstracting these models to TL ones, however, is a challenging task, especially when the RTL description is too obscure or not accessible. This work presents a methodology for automatically creating a TL model of an RTL memory controller component. The device is treated as a black box and a multitude of simulations is used to obtain results, showing its timing behavior. The results are classified into conditional probability distributions, which are reused within a TL model to approximate the RTL timing behavior.

In particular, we illustrate how dynamic ABV can integrate and improve the various stages of the embedded-software verification flow. The analysis leads us to develop a comprehensive ABV environment that integrates the still missing automatic synthesis of executable checkers for embedded software. Experiments show that the proposed environment reduces the verification-team efforts and makes dynamic ABV practical for embedded-software design.","","978-1-4673-1187-8","978-1-4673-1186-1","10.1109/DDECS.2012.6219083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219083","","Embedded software;Hardware;Hysteresis;Monitoring;Temperature;Testing","embedded systems;formal specification;formal verification","assertion-based verification;design specification conformance;dynamic ABV;embedded system;embedded-software design;embedded-software dynamic verification;embedded-software verification flow;executable checker;formal ABV;functional verification;hardware design emulation;hardware design verification;silicon debug","","","","0","","25","","","20120618","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A co-design methodology for processor-centric embedded systems with hardware acceleration using FPGA","Pedre, S.; Krajnik, T.; Todorovich, E.; Borensztejn, P.","Dept. de Comput., Univ. de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Programmable Logic (SPL), 2012 VIII Southern Conference on","20-23 March 2012","2012","","","1","8","In this work a co-design flow for processor centric embedded systems with hardware acceleration using FPGAs is proposed. This flow helps to reduce design effort by raising abstraction level while not imposing the need for engineers to learn new languages and tools. The whole system is designed using well established high level modeling techniques, languages and tools from the software domain. That is, an OOP design approach expressed in UML and implemented in C++. Software coding effort is reduced since the C++ implementation not only provides a golden reference model, but may also be used as part of the final embedded software. Hardware coding effort is also reduced. The modular OOP design facilitates the engineer to find the exact methods that need to be accelerated by hardware using profiling tools, preventing useless translations to hardware. Moreover, the two-process structured VHDL design method used for hardware implementation has proven to reduce man-years, code lines and bugs in many major developments. A real-time image processing application for multiple robot localization is presented as a case study. The overall time improvement from the original software solution to the final hardware accelerated solution is 9.7×, with only 4% increase in area (143 extra slices). The embedded solution achieved following the proposed methodology runs 17% faster than in a standard PC, and it is a much smaller, cheaper and less power-consuming solution.","","978-1-4673-0184-8","","10.1109/SPL.2012.6211770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211770","","Acceleration;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Robots;Software;Testing;Unified modeling language","C++ language;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;image processing","C++ implementation;FPGA;OOP design approach;abstraction level;co-design flow;co-design methodology;embedded software;hardware acceleration;hardware coding;hardware implementation;high level modeling technique;modular OOP design;multiple robot localization;power-consuming solution;processor-centric embedded system;real-time image processing application;software coding;software domain;two-process structured VHDL design","","","","1","","24","","","20120607","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper addresses a number of important issues that make this approach practical: 1) finding initial state for each simulation slice; 2) resolving initial state mismatches; and 3) handling designs with multiple asynchronous clocks.

TLM provides designers with high-level interfaces and communication protocols for abstract modeling and efficient simulation of system platforms. The Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI) has recently released the TLM-2.0 standard, to standardize the interface between component models for bus-based systems. The TLM standard aims at facilitating the interchange of models between suppliers and users, and thus encouraging the use of virtual platforms for fast simulation prior to the availability of register-transfer level (RTL) code. On the other hand, because a TLM IP description does not include the implementation details that must be added at the RTL, the process to synthesize TLM designs into RTL implementations is still manual, time spending and error prone. In this context, this paper presents a methodology for automating the TLM-to-RTL synthesis by applying the theory of high-level synthesis (HLS) to TLM, and proposes a protocol synthesis technique based on the extended finite state machine (EFSM) model for generating the RTL IP interface compliant with any RTL bus-based protocol.","1552-6674","978-1-4244-7805-7","","10.1109/HLDVT.2010.5496652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496652","","Computer science;Hardware;High level synthesis;Memory management;Positron emission tomography;Power system modeling;Process design;Protocols;Software design;System-on-a-chip","embedded systems;finite state machines;high level synthesis;industrial property;integrated circuit design;protocols;system buses;system-on-chip","OSCI TLM-2.0 models;Open SystemC Initiative;RTL IP interface compliant;RTL bus-based IP;RTL bus-based protocol;TLM-2.0 standard;abstract modeling;bus-based systems;communication protocols;embedded system complexity;extended finite state machine model;high-level interfaces;high-level synthesis;protocol synthesis technique;register-transfer level code;system platform simulation;transaction-level modeling;virtual platforms","","","","1","","23","","","20100628","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Masking is only effective on the condition that the internal random mask remains a secret. Previous research has illustrated how a successful estimation of the mask bit in circuit-level masking leads to successful side-channel attacks. In this paper, we extend this concept to algorithmic masking, which uses multi-bit masks. Our key observation is that the power dissipation of a masked circuit and the mask value are not independent. We exploit this property by using a slice of the power samples obtained by partial selection. This slice has a statistically biased mask, even when the mask signal itself is generated with a uniform distribution. We demonstrate this attack by showing how a perfectly masked AES SBox can be broken using part of the observed power samples, while the same circuit remains secure if we use all of the observed power samples.","","978-1-4244-2401-6","","10.1109/HST.2008.4559041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559041","Differential Power Analysis masking;Side-channel Attack;slice","Algorithm design and analysis;Boolean functions;Hardware;Logic circuits;Microcontrollers;Power dissipation;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Random variables;Signal generators","low-power electronics;power aware computing;security of data","AES SBox;algorithmic masking;internal random mask;multi-bit masks;perfect hardware masking scheme slicing;power dissipation;side-channel countermeasure;side-channel leakage;statistically biased mask","","","","1","","14","","","20080709","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computer platforms are multi-core architectures and every new technology generation increases the number of transistors. Computer architects have to establish computational structures that can transform the increase in transistors into an equal increase in computational performance efficiency. The multi-core architecture requires runtime systems to support parallel execution, the productive expression and efficient exploitation of parallelism. Parallel programming evolves to utilize tens of cores now and will evolve to support hundreds of them in the near future. Many/multi-core architecture with hundreds of cores will change the memory organizations of computer system to avoid bottleneck of performance. There is a need to design effective programming techniques and operating system concepts to fulfil all possibilities given by massive multi-core architectures. Despite of CPU oriented architectures reconfigurable computing (RC) is gaining popularity in many different domains. The main advantage of such systems is that they can adapt to static and dynamic application requirements better than those with fixed hardware. The special MIXDES session dedicated to High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation is devoted to the challenges of modern embedded architectures and computation techniques. The special session is supported by HiPEAC network (www.hipeac.net) and it is addressed to establish HiPEAC activity in Poland.","","978-1-4244-7011-2","978-83-928756-4-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551688","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20100819","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work elaborates on a custom methodology for automatically encapsulating the data-parallel sections of the MPEG-4 XviD the G723.1 and G729A reference codes into a SystemC wrapper which is subsequently synthesized to RTL with a commercial SystemC-synthesis tool. The resulting RTL is then attached to the exposed vector unit of the SS_SPARC engine.

Time-parallel simulation enables parallel execution of tasks in different intervals in the timeline by resolving data dependencies between them with redundant host code execution.

However, the focus has been put on modeling aspects until now and quantitative performance analysis is not adequately taken into account in early design stages of the system. In this paper, we present our approach for formal and simulation based performance analysis of systems specified with UML2/SysML. The basis of our analysis approach is the detection of communication that synchronize the control flow of the corresponding instances of the system and make the relationship explicit. Using this knowledge, we are able to determine a global timing behavior and violations of this effected by preset constraints. Hence, it is also possible to detect potential conflicts on shared communication resources if a specification of the target architecture is given.

The standard TLM aims at facilitating the interchange of models between suppliers and users, and thus encouraging the use of virtual platforms for fast simulation prior to the availability of register-transfer level (RTL) code. This paper discusses on the mutation analysis concept applied to the TLM context and proposes a mutation model for perturbing TLM SystemC descriptions.

Assertion based verification (ABV) has already given a good return of investment for RTL designs. We expect the same benefit from leveraging ABV on transaction level; however mapping RTL ABV methodology directly to TL poses severe problems due to the abstraction of time and different model of computation.

The proposed methodology is driven by the requirements and the scenarios in the specification with design and verification going hand in hand. An early formalization of requirements and scenarios produces a set of properties and a testbench together with a code skeleton that will be successively extended to a full SystemC ESL model.

"FlashTrie: Beyond 100-Gb/s IP Route Lookup Using Hash-Based Prefix-Compressed Trie","Bando, M.; Yi-Li Lin; Chao, H.J.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on","Aug. 2012","2012","20","4","1262","1275","It is becoming apparent that the next-generation IP route lookup architecture needs to achieve speeds of 100 Gb/s and beyond while supporting IPv4 and IPv6 with fast real-time updates to accommodate ever-growing routing tables. Some of the proposed multibit-trie-based schemes, such as TreeBitmap, have been used in today's high-end routers. However, their large data structures often require multiple external memory accesses for each route lookup. A pipelining technique is widely used to achieve high-speed lookup with the cost of using many external memory chips. Pipelining also often leads to poor memory load-balancing. In this paper, we propose a new IP route lookup architecture called FlashTrie that overcomes the shortcomings of the multibit-trie-based approaches. We use a hash-based membership query to limit off-chip memory accesses per lookup and to balance memory utilization among the memory modules. By compacting the data structure size, the lookup depth of each level can be increased. We also develop a new data structure called Prefix-Compressed Trie that reduces the size of a bitmap by more than 80%.

To design WLAN nodes, precise estimations on performance and resource usage are needed for the complete network system to explore the design space and assess the quality of solutions. Our SystemClick framework combines SystemC with resource models and performance annotations derived from actual implementations based on Click.

The possibility of deadlock across components, mismatch in temporal behaviors at the connected interface signals, etc., could lead to non-reactivity or subtle bugs. Behavioral interface theories have been proposed for checking compatibility of components when reactive modules are being composed. Depending on the models of computation, various intermediate notions of behavioral interfaces may be defined. In the case of polychronous components, the clock relations and the data dependencies at the interfaces are usually used for checking compatibility. However, if the behavior of a component is time variant, these abstractions are insufficient to establish correctness of composition. To capture time varying behavior, we propose to add an automaton based abstraction based on predicates abstraction. This paper describes the extraction of the abstraction, along with proofs of equivalence and the description of a practical implementation of the technique.","","","","10.1109/SAMOS.2013.6621103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621103","","Adders;Automata;Clocks;Computer bugs;Process control;Synchronization;System recovery","automata theory;data flow computing;formal specification;theorem proving","automaton based abstraction;behavioral interface theories;checking compatibility;connected interface signals;deadlock across components;mode-automata;polychronous components;polychronous dataflow specification abstraction;reactive embedded software design;subtle bugs;temporal behaviors mismatch","","","","0","","","","","20131007","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a hardware architecture with a distributed controller, which makes the timing closure problem much easier. It also presents a novel high-level synthesis flow for synthesizing such hardware through datapath partitioning and controller optimization. According to our experimental results, the proposed approach reduces the controller and interconnect delay by 20.3-27.4% and the entire critical path delay by 6.6~10.3% with 0.2~13.3% area overhead.

Cost-efficient development of electronic control units (ECUs) for these systems is a complex challenge. The demand for shortened time to market makes the development even more challenging and thus demands efficient design flows. This paper proposes a model-based design flow that permits simulation-based performance evaluation of multi-core ECUs for driver assistance systems in a pre-development stage. The approach is based on a system-level virtual prototype of a multi-core ECU and allows the evaluation of timing effects by mapping application tasks to different platforms. The results show that performance estimation of different parallel implementation candidates is possible with high accuracy even in a pre-development stage. By adapting the best-fitting parallelization strategy to the final ECU, a reduction in the time to market period is possible. Currently, the design flow is being evaluated by Daimler AG and is being applied to a pedestrian detection system. Results from this application illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach.","","978-1-4673-2295-9","978-1-4673-2296-6","10.1109/SAMOS.2012.6404155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404155","","Calibration;Computer architecture;Estimation;Hardware;Production;Prototypes;Vehicles","driver information systems;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;road vehicles;virtual prototyping","Daimler AG;driver assistance system;electronic control unit;lane departure warning;model-based design flow;multicore ECU development;parallel implementation candidate;parallelization strategy;pedestrian detection;pedestrian detection system;road vehicle;simulation-based performance evaluation;system-level virtual prototype;timing effect;traffic sign recognition","","","","0","","21","","","20130110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, with the introduction of advanced MEMS sensors and actuators and the penetration of new technologies in many diverse everyday tasks, with complicated control mechanisms and advanced calculations, it has been made clear that traditional PLCs need a technology boost. This boost can be offered by modern FPGA devices so a number of automated or semi-automated translating methodologies from PLC to FPGA have been proposed. This paper presents the effects of coding styles in a translation methodology using C-based hardware design and the corresponding high-level synthesis toolset. As it is shown, C-based hardware design offers optimization opportunities for floating point calculations not found in traditional HDL-based hardware design, provided specific coding guidelines are followed. These guidelines are integrated in a systematic translation methodology and their effects are compared to the effects of architectural optimizations offered by high-level synthesis. As shown in the experimental results, algorithmic optimizations (coding styles) clearly outperform architectural optimizations and so, their use is highly recommended for the development of next generation FPGA based controllers.","","978-1-4673-4534-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379212","","Algorithm design and analysis;Encoding;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Optimization;Registers","C language;field programmable gate arrays;high level synthesis;microactuators;microsensors;programmable controllers","C-based PLC;C-based hardware design;FPGA devices;FPGA translation;MEMS actuators;MEMS sensors;algorithmic optimizations;architectural optimizations;automated translating methodologies;coding guidelines;coding styles;control algorithms;high-level synthesis toolset;semi automated translating methodologies;systematic translation methodology;technology boost","","","","0","","18","","","20121213","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a remedy, the work at hand proposes a novel automatic platform-based system synthesis procedure, inspired by techniques developed in the context of automatic system verification known as Satisfiability Modulo Theories. It tightly couples the computation of a feasible allocation and binding with nonfunctional constraint checking where, in contrast to existing approaches, not only linear constraints but even nonlinear constraints are supported. This allows to efficiently prove whether there exists a feasible implementation of a set of applications on the given platform with respect to both, functional and nonfunctional constraints. Moreover, an approach for early learning based on feasibility checking of partial implementations is proposed that can significantly improve the synthesis runtime, especially in case the selected platform imposes stringent constraints on the implementation. The effectiveness of this approach is shown for an automotive ECU network design that requires Modular Performance Analysis to ensure nonfunctional nonlinear timing constraints.","","978-1-6055-8905-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751492","Algorithms;Design","Complexity theory;Decision trees;Encoding;Program processors;Resource management;Timing","computability;computational complexity;program verification","automatic platform-based system synthesis;automatic system verification;automotive ECU network;modular performance analysis;nonfunctional constraints;nonfunctional nonlinear timing constraints;nonlinear constraints;satisfiability modulo theories solving;system complexity","","","","2","","23","","","20110415","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also the requirements for reducing pollution and increasing the service quality are issues, which have led to the introduction of SmartGrids network concepts. These network solutions are mostly dependent on power electronics, applied to connection of loads, generation and storages to the independently operable low-voltage (LV) grids. One of such solutions is the low voltage DC (LVDC) distribution system, which is an interesting challenger to the AC low voltage network solutions. An often-asked question is how the shorter lifetimes of power electronics compared to the traditional network components affect on the reliability of the electricity distribution and also to its total costs. In the this paper the question about the reliability development is approached from two mainpoints of view: The component level focusing on the reliability of power electronics based network components, and the system level concentrating on the power quality experienced by the customers and the effects of converters on the entire distribution system reliability. The question of the reliability impact of large-scale utilization of power electronics in electricity distribution is relevant, when considering the direction of the technical development in electricity distribution. This paper is especially aimed at discussing the modelling of the reliability impacts in the case of the LVDC-system.","0537-9989","978-0-86341-935-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4591872","","","power convertors;power distribution reliability;power electronics;power grids","AC low voltage network solutions;SmartGrids network concepts;converters;cost effectiveness;distribution network development;distribution system reliability;electricity distribution;operable low-voltage grids;pollution reduction;power electronics;power quality;power system reliability;reliability development;service quality","","","","0","","","","","20080808","","IET","","IET Conference Publications"

Not only has software become the key functional differentiator in many areas; its development cycle now determines the overall project success. Market research firm International Business Strategies, Inc. claims that today at 90 nm the typical overall SoC-related development effort for software has already surpassed the effort for hardware. For 45 nm designs in the year 2011, IBS projects that less than 40 percent of the overall development efforts will be spent on hardware. Given the ever growing levels of complexity, traditional approaches to developing embedded software are failing to meet the challenge; a new era of software development has begun in which the majority of embedded software is developed with virtual prototypes, in contrast to traditional software development on hardware boards.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2010.5473862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473862","","Application software;Automotive engineering;Electronics industry;Embedded software;Hardware;Market research;Programming;Silicon;Software prototyping;Virtual prototyping","electronic engineering computing;embedded systems;semiconductor industry;software engineering;system-on-chip;virtual prototyping","embedded software;semiconductor industry;size 45 nm;size 90 nm;software development;software-dominated communication system designs;system-on-chip;virtual prototypes","","","","1","","6","","","20100527","","IEEE","IEEE Communications Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The software development platform is an abstract model of the architecture allowing to execute the software with detailed hardware-software interaction, performance measurement and software debug. Different software development platforms are generated automatically from an initial Simulink model and are used to debug the different software components and to easily experiment with several mappings of the application onto the platform resources.

When GC conflicts with an I/O stream, the stream can make no forward progress until the GC cycle completes. GC cycles are scheduled by logic internal to the SSD based on several factors such as the pattern, frequency, and volume of write requests. When SSDs are used in a RAID with currently available technology, the lack of coordination of the SSD-local GC cycles amplifies this performance variance. We propose a global garbage collection (GGC) mechanism to improve response times and reduce performance variability for a RAID of SSDs. We include a high-level design of SSD-aware RAID controller and GGC-capable SSD devices and algorithms to coordinate the GGC cycles.

It is well-accepted that specialization is the key to efficiency. This paper establishes a baseline by studying GEneral Matrix-matrix Multiplication (GEMM) on a variety of custom and general-purpose CPU and GPU architectures. Our analysis shows that orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency are possible with relatively simple customizations and fine-tuning of memory hierarchy configurations. We argue that these customizations can be generalized to perform other representative linear algebra operations. In addition to exposing the sources of inefficiencies in current CPUs and GPUs, our results show our prototype Linear Algebra Processor (LAP) implementing Double-precision GEMM (DGEMM) can achieve 600 GFLOPS while consuming less than 25 Watts in standard 45 nm technology, which is up to 50 × more energy efficient than cutting-edge CPUs.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212466","Low-power design;energy-aware systems;level-3 BLAS;matrix multiplication;memory hierarchy;performance analysis and design aids;special-purpose hardware","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Energy efficiency;Energy management;Field programmable gate arrays;Linear algebra;Low power electronics;Memory management;System-on-a-chip","graphics processing units;linear algebra;low-power electronics;matrix multiplication;memory architecture;power consumption","BLAS;DGEMM;GFLOPS;GPU architecture;LAP;codesign tradeoff;double-precision GEMM;general matrix-matrix multiplication;general-purpose CPU;high-performance linear algebra architecture;level-3 basic linear algebra subprograms;linear algebra operation;linear algebra processor;low-power linear algebra architecture;memory hierarchy configuration;power consumption;size 45 nm","","","","5","","","","2012-06-05","20121024","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this scenario, the exploration and verification of several architecture models early in the design flow has played an important role. This paper proposes a mechanism that relies on computational reflection to enable designers to interact, on the fly, with platform simulation models written in SystemC TLM. This allows them to monitor and change signals or even IP internal register values, thus injecting specific stimuli that guide the simulation flow through corner cases during platform debugging, which are usually hard to handle by standard techniques, thus improving functional coverage. The key advantages of our approach are that we do not require code instrumentation from the IP designer, do not need a specialized SystemC library, and not even need the IP source code to be able to inspect its contents. The reflection mechanism was implemented using a C++ reflection library and integrated into a platform modeling framework. We evaluate our technique through some platform case studies.","","978-1-5959-3824-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753864","Computational Reflection;Debugging;Platform-based Design;System Architecture","Clocks;Debugging;Dictionaries;Hardware;IP networks;Libraries;Registers","C++ language;computer debugging;source coding;system-on-chip;systems analysis","C++ reflection library;IP internal register values;IP source code;SoC;SystemC;architecture models;computational reflection mechanism;electronics systems;platform debugging;system-level design;transaction level modeling","","","","0","","","","","20110421","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Executable specifications obtained from TLM models are used for the exploration of various architectural parameters and configurations possible for a system. However, traditional design flows based on TLM don't take into account the area and energy consumption of the system which are inevitably the most important constraints in modern embedded system designs. Traditionally, area and energy estimation is incorporated in system design at RTL (Register Transfer Level) which comes later in system design cycles and most of the crucial design decisions for the system has already been taken at that stage. In this paper, we propose a methodology to incorporate area and energy estimation in TLM based system modeling. This methodology allows a system designer take system level design decisions in very early stages of system design hence avoiding redesign efforts and performance bottlenecks in advanced stages of a project. Results obtained by applying our methodology on an image processing application show the robustness of our approach.","","1-4244-0764-8","1-4244-0765-6","10.1109/ICM.2006.373297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4243679","Area and Energy Estimation;Behavioral Synthesis;Hardware/Software Codesign;Transaction Level Modeling","Decision making;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Hardware;Modeling;Phase estimation;Product development;Rockets;Sun;Time to market","hardware-software codesign","HW/SW design flow;area estimation;electronic product development;energy estimation;hardware/software codesign;image processing;register transfer level;system level design;transaction level modeling","","","","1","","18","","","20070618","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an interactive RTL design environment which enables designers to control the design steps and to integrate hardware components into a system. Our design environment is targeting a generic RTL processor architecture and supporting pipelining, multicycling, and chaining. Tasks in the RTL design process include clock definition, component allocation, scheduling, binding, and validation. In our interactive environment, the user can control the design process at every stage, observe the effects of design decisions, and manually override synthesis decisions at will. We present a set of experimental results that demonstrate the benefits of our approach.

In this paper we present the concept of an ESL framework for timing and power aware rapid virtual system prototyping of embedded HW/SW systems. Our proposed flow combines system-level timing and power estimation techniques available in commercial tools with platform-based rapid prototyping. Our proposal aims at the generation of executable virtual prototypes from a functional C/C++ specification. These prototypes are enriched by static and dynamic power values as well as execution times. They allow a trade-off between different platforms, mapping alternatives, and optimization techniques, based on domain-specific workload scenarios.

With the common use of intellectual properties (IPs) in SoC and the large amount of data interchanges among IPs, communication architecture significantly affects the system in terms of power and performance. Therefore, designers should carefully plan the communication architecture to meet the power and performance requirements. While repeatedly performing a power optimization under a performance constraint approach N times seems practical for the power and performance co-exploration, the time required to explore such solutions inevitably increases, since there are numerous performance constraints. This paper presents a pseudo-parallel method for bus architecture exploration at the system level (PBAES) to speedup the power and performance of co-exploration time. PBAES can intelligently search interesting portions of the design space to enhance the efficiency of co-exploration, and share the candidate solutions of each to achieve a more rapid overall exploration. The experimental results indicate that PBAES is 1.6 times to 14 times faster than an approach without the pseudo-parallel method with a generated architecture of similar quality.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2009.2021733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5166607","Design space exploration;on-chip communication architecture;power-performance tradeoffs;system-on-a-chip (SoC)","","integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","SoC;bus architecture exploration;intellectual properties;pseudoparallel algorithm;system-level bus-based communication architecture;system-on-a-chip","","","","1","","26","","","20090717","","IEEE","IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Following are some of the key activities in any product development flow. 1) System Engineering 2) Map customer requirements to design features. 3) Optimize design to meet the requirements in the best possible way. 4) Hardware design 5) Design, develop and integrate different Hardware (HW) or design modules/blocks 6) Develop reference models for validating different modules/blocks/sub-systems 7) Software development 8) Design, develop and integrate different Software (SW) modules 9) Develop reference models for validating these modules/sub-systems 10) System Validation 11) Build a system 12) Port the software onto the system 13) Validate the system with true system scenarios. 14) Customer Delivery. Traditionally, many of these development activities have always been mostly sequential in nature. This type of sequential flow cannot help in meeting the time-to-market requirements of today's consumer products. Some of the most popular alternatives to this kind of sequential development flow include a) FPGA prototyping of the system b) Develop prototype using Instruction Set Simulators (ISS) c) Virtual System Prototyping (VSP). The first option lacks the required flexibility and need to have the complete micro-architecture defined before designing the prototype. Traditional ISS solutions are used for simulating processors with few or no perip- herals connected. ISS solutions are therefore used for verifying small portions of the embedded code and not directly suitable for true system simulations. VSP definitely addresses these issues. The concept of VSP is based on creating a software model of the entire hardware system including external components (e.g. base station model for checking the base band systems). This model can be used to explore and analyze different architectures. Once an optimal architecture has been chosen, the same model can be used as an executable specification. HW design teams can use the VSP as a golden reference model against which they can verify the functionality of different modules and/or subsystems in the design. SW teams can use VSP to start their development work, as soon as the architecture is defined and the corresponding VSP is available. As a part of this work, attempt has been made to highlight advantages and challenges of virtual prototyping with a case study.","","978-1-4244-2781-9","978-1-4244-2782-6","10.1109/VDAT.2009.5158104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5158104","","Computer architecture;Design engineering;Embedded software;Hardware;Product design;Product development;Productivity;Robustness;Time to market;Virtual prototyping","time to market;virtual prototyping","SoC;consumer products;embedded code;embedded memories;embedded software;instruction set simulators;microcontrollers;product development flow;productivity;reference models;sequential development flow;simulating processors;software development;software model;system engineering;time-to-market requirements;time-to-market schedules;virtual system prototyping","","","","1","","19","","","20090707","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SystemC is a popular modeling language which can be used to specify systems at a high abstraction level. The module hierarchy of a SystemC model is dynamically constructed during the execution of the elaboration phase of the model. This means that a system designer can build regular structures using loops and conditional statements. Currently, most SystemC tools can not cope with SystemC models for which the module hierarchy depends on dynamic parameters. In our approach this hierarchical information is retrieved by controlling and monitoring the executing of the elaboration phase of the model using a GDB debugger. Thereafter, the behavioral information is retrieved by using a GCC plug-in. This plug-in produces abstract syntax trees in static single assignment form. This behavioral information is linked with the hierarchical information. Our approach is completely non-intrusive. The SystemC model and the SystemC reference implementation can be used without any modification. We have implemented our approach in a SystemC front-end called SHaBE (SystemC Hierarchy and Behavior Extractor). This front-end facilitates the development of future SystemC visualization, debugging, static verification, and synthesis tools.","0738-100x","978-1-4503-0636-2","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5981956","AST;Automation;GCC;GDB;SystemC;analyze;dynamic module hierarchy;elaboration;front-end;system specification","Adders;Analytical models;Arrays;Complexity theory;Data models;Finite impulse response filter;Libraries","computational linguistics;high level languages;program debugging;program verification","GCC plug-in;GDB debugger;SHaBE;SystemC front-end;SystemC hierarchy;abstract syntax trees;abstraction level;dynamic parameters;dynamically generated module hierarchy;extracting behavior;hierarchical information;modeling language;static single assignment form;static verification","","","","1","","13","","","20110811","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can achieve zero aliasing, full X-tolerance, and high diagnosability. One critical issue for output selection is how to implement the selection hardware. In this paper, we present a counter-based output selection scheme that employs only a counter and a multiplexer, hence involving very small area overhead and simple test control. The proposed scheme is ATPG-independent and thus can easily be incorporated into a typical design flow. Two efficient output selection algorithms are presented to determine the desired output responses, one using a single counter operation for simpler test control and the other using more counter operations for achieving a better test-response reduction ratio. Experimental results show that for stuck-at faults in large ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmark circuits, 48%~90% reduction ratios on test responses can be achieved with only one counter and one multiplexer employed. Even better results, i.e., 76%~95% reductions, can be obtained for transition faults. It is also shown that the diagnostic resolution of this method is almost the same as that achieved by observing all output responses.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2012.2214479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387700","Fault diagnosis;output selection;test compression;test response compaction","Circuit faults;Compaction;Dictionaries;Fault detection;Heuristic algorithms;Multiplexing;Radiation detectors","counting circuits;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing;logic testing","counter based output selection;full X-tolerance;multiplexer;stuck-at faults;test control;test response compaction;zero aliasing","","","","0","","32","","","20121219","","IEEE","IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In general, KPNs are difficult to analyze at design-time. Thus a special case of the KPN model, called Polyhedral Process Networks (PPN), has been proposed to address the analyzability issue. However, the PPN model is not able to capture adaptive/dynamic behavior. Such behavior is usually expressed by using parameters which values are reconfigured at run-time. To model the adaptive/dynamic applications, in this paper we introduce an extension of the PPN model, called Parameterized Polyhedral Process Networks (P<sup>3</sup>N), which still provides design-time analyzability to some extent. We first formally define the P<sup>3</sup>N model and its operational semantics. In addition, we devise a design-time analysis to extract relations between parameters. Based on the analysis, we propose an approach to ensure that consistent execution of the P<sup>3</sup>N model is preserved at run-time.

Moreover, they have a strict interaction with the surrounding physical environment. Traditional approaches for modeling such systems rely either on homogeneous top-down methodologies or on co-simulation frameworks. The former are generally based on a single model of computation. Thus, they do not easily allow to integrate existing components built by using different formalisms. The latter assemble heterogeneous components without providing a rigorous formal support, thus making integration and validation a very hard tasks. This paper proposes UNIVERCM, a formal computational model that allows to represent with a uniform syntax and a precise semantics heterogeneous systems composed of SW, analog and digital HW, as well as the environment they are embedded in.

Synchronization problems or bugs due to race conditions are particularly difficult to detect with existing debugging tools. Most traditional debugging approaches rely on globally synchronized signals, but these pose their own problems in terms of scalability. The first contribution of this paper is to propose a novel non-uniform debugging architecture (NUDA) based on a ring interconnection schema. Our approach makes hardware-assisted debugging both feasible and scalable for many-core processing scenarios. The key idea is to distribute the debugging support structures across a set of hierarchical clusters while avoiding address overlap. The design strategy allows the address space to be monitored using non-uniform protocols. Our second contribution is to propose a nonintrusive approach to lockset-based race detection supported by the NUDA. A non-uniform page-based monitoring cache in each NUDA node is used to keep track of the access footprints. The union of all the caches can serve as a race detection probe without disturbing execution ordering. Using the proposed approach, we show that parallel race bugs can be precisely captured, and that most false-positive alerts can be efficiently eliminated at an average slowdown cost of only 1.4-3.6 percent. The net hardware cost is relatively low, so that the NUDA can easily be scaled to increasingly complex many-core systems.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669276","NUDA;data race;debugging.;lockset;manycore;nonintrusive","Computer aided manufacturing;Computer architecture;Debugging;Hardware;Histograms;Monitoring;Synchronization","multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;program debugging;synchronisation","access footprint tracking;address overlap avoidance;debugging support structure;false-positive alert;hardware-assisted debugging;hierarchical cluster;lockset-based race detection;many-core parallel programming;many-core processing;many-core system;nonintrusive race detection;nonuniform debugging architecture;nonuniform page-based monitoring cache;nonuniform protocol;parallel race bugs;ring interconnection schema;synchronization problem","","","","1","","31","","2010-12-17","20111229","","IEEE","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, power is transferred from a floor to a power relay in the patient's jacket via strong coupling. Next, power is delivered from the power relay to the capsule via loose coupling. Besides making patients much more conformable, the proposed techniques eliminate the sources of reliability issues arisen from the moving cable and connectors. In the capsule, it is critical to enhance the power conversion efficiency.

Starting at the application level, there is a need for programming models and communications APIs that allow applications to be easily re-configured for many different possible architectures without tedious rewriting, while at the same time ensuring efficient production code. Synchronisation and control of task scheduling may be provided by RTOS's or other scheduling methods, and the choice of programming and threading models, whether symmetric or asymmetric, has a heavy influence on how best to control task or thread execution. Debugging MP systems for the typical application developer becomes a much more complex job, when compared to traditional single-processor debug, or the debug of simple MP systems that are only very loosely coupled.

The architecture design debugging is done on a cycle-accurate level. Nowadays embedded systems are often parallel-based. Therefore, it is important to allow debugging of systems with more than one application-specific instruction set processors (ASIP). Since the current trend of ASIP design is focused on automatic tool-chain generation, the debugger must be retargetable to arbitrary architecture. In this paper, we present the concept of an automatically generated multi-level retargetable debugger.

Low power optimization techniques are, therefore, widely applied towards the development of modern application specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs). Architecture description languages (ADLs) offer the ASIP designers a quick and optimal design convergence by automatically generating the software tool-suite as well as the register transfer level (RTL) description of the processor. The automatically generated processor description is then subjected to the traditional RTL-based synthesis flow. Power-specific optimizations, often found in RTL-based commercial tools, cannot take the full advantage of the architectural knowledge embedded in the ADL description, resulting in sub-optimal power efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by describing an efficient and universal technique of automatic insertion of gated clocks during the ADL-based ASIP design flow. Experiments with ASIP benchmarks show the dramatic impact of our approach by reducing power consumption up to 41% percent compared to naive RTL synthesis from ADL description, without any incurred overhead for area and speed","","1-4244-0179-8","1-4244-0180-1","10.1109/VDAT.2006.258140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4027512","","Application software;Application specific processors;Architecture description languages;Clocks;Convergence;Design optimization;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Registers;Software tools","application specific integrated circuits;circuit optimisation;clocks;instruction sets;integrated circuit design;logic design;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips","ADL-driven ASIP design;RTL-based synthesis flow;application specific instruction-set processors;architecture description languages;automatic low power optimizations;battery-life;embedded systems;gated clocks insertion;register transfer level;software tool-suite","","","","1","","15","","","20061211","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous studies have shown that the patterns generated by a conventional automatic test pattern generation procedure to detect all unacceptable faults also detect many acceptable ones, resulting in a severe loss on achievable yield improvement. In this paper, we present a novel test methodology called multiple test set detection (MTSD) to totally eliminate this overdetection problem. A basic test set generation method is first presented, which depicts a fundamental scheme to generate appropriate test sets for MTSD. We then describe an enhanced test generation method that can significantly reduce the total number of test patterns.

Usually, the output of these approaches is an ""ad hoc"" implementation, which is hard to reuse in further refinement steps. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatic generation of heterogeneous MPSoC virtual prototypes starting with models for streaming applications. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in the fact that it is open to subsequent design steps.

Such systems fundamentally change the problem of power scheduling. Instead of maximizing system lifetime with a fixed amount of energy as in battery-powered systems, the purpose of scheduling becomes the prevention of energy depletion at any given time. On the other hand, partial dynamic reconfiguration is demonstrated as an efficient technique for intensive applications, such as video and encryption processing. Unlike software (SW)-based implementation, reconfigurable hardware (HW) requires time and energy for reconfiguration before enabling the application, which causes a trade-off between the SW and the reconfigurable HW. Therefore, when reconfigurable HW is applied in an energy-harvesting system, the problem lies in the manner by which to schedule the dynamic reconfiguration, such that the dynamically harvested energy is efficiently used. In this paper, a novel methodology is presented for the scheduling of the dynamic reconfiguration for a WSN node under energy-harvesting conditions based on statistical information on tasks and available energy. To evaluate our method, an HW-reconfigurable WSN node is prototyped, and related experimental data are collected. Our experiments demonstrate that by implementing our method, more than 50% of the energy costs can be saved with a 50% performance improvement.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2247038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461380","Energy efficiency;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR);scheduling strategy;wireless sensor network (WSN)","Dynamic scheduling;Equations;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Mathematical model;Software;Wireless sensor networks","electric sensing devices;energy harvesting;scheduling;wireless sensor networks","HW;SW;WSN;battery-powered systems;dynamically reconfigurable hardware;encryption processing;energy depletion;energy-harvesting sensor network;partial dynamic reconfiguration;power scheduling strategy;renewable energy;software based implementation;solar radiation;statistical information;system lifetime maximization;video processing;wireless sensor network","","","","0","","24","","2013-02-13","20130411","","IEEE","IEEE Sensors Council","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hardware prototyping is not needed in the early design phase, as similar functionality can be achieved quicker and more flexibly with virtual platform models. In this paper the virtual platform model is used for hardware architecture exploration. We evaluated the design method of a 3D video recorder and measured the time and effort needed to build and run complete system simulations using real software. The results suggest that virtual platform modeling is a viable option for architecture exploration, but only if its limitations due to abstracted models are understood. The design process of a virtual platform without prior experience of the tools was measured to be 16 weeks for two designers. Afterwards, changes to the hardware platform could be made in less than 2 weeks depending on how challenging they are.","","978-0-7695-2978-3","","10.1109/DSD.2007.4341499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341499","","Computer architecture;Design methodology;Embedded software;Hardware;Network-on-a-chip;Software measurement;Software prototyping;Software systems;System-on-a-chip;Virtual prototyping","video recording;virtual instrumentation","3D video recorder;hardware architecture exploration;virtual platform models","","","","0","","13","","","20071008","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Together with Forte Design Systems, a fully automated approach was developed by integrating behavioral synthesis into the design flow. Starting from a behavioral SystemC model, hardware accelerators can be generated automatically using Forte Cynthesizer and can be added to the design space. The resulting design space is explored automatically by optimizing several objectives simultaneously using state of the art multi-objective optimization algorithms. As a result, SystemCoDesigner presents optimized hardware/software solutions to the designer who can select any of them for rapid prototyping on an FPGA basis. Thus, SystemCoDesigner bridges the gap from ESL to RTL and increases the confidence in early design decisions.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555883","Design Space Exploration;ESL Design;Rapid Prototyping","Algorithm design and analysis;Bridges;Design automation;Design optimization;Electronic design automation and methodology;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Space exploration","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;logic design;optimisation","ESL tool;FPGA basis;Forte Cynthesizer;Forte Design Systems;SystemCoDesigner;automatic design space exploration;behavioral SystemC models;behavioral synthesis;design flow;hardware accelerators;multiobjective optimization algorithms;optimized hardware/software solutions;rapid prototyping","","","","1","","","","","20080702","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware/software co-design means meeting system level objectives by exploiting the synergism of hardware and software through their concurrent design. Co-design problems have different flavors according to the application domain, implementation technology and design methodology. Digital hardware design has increasingly more similarities to software design. Hardware circuits are often described using modeling or programming languages, and they are validated and implemented by executing software programs, which are sometimes conceived for the specific hardware design. Current integrated circuits can incorporate one (or more) processor core(s) and memory array(s) on a single substrate. These “systems on silicon” exhibit a sizable amount of embedded software, which provides flexibility for product evolution and differentiation purposes. Thus the design of these systems requires designers to be knowledgeable in both hardware and software domains to make good design tradeoffs. The paper introduces various aspects of co-design. We highlight the commonalities and point out the differences in various co-design problems in some application areas. Co-design issues and their relationship to classical system implementation tasks are discussed to help develop a perspective on modern digital system design that relies on computer aided design (CAD) tools and methods","0018-9219","","","10.1109/5.558708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=558708","","Application software;Consumer electronics;Control systems;Demand forecasting;Design automation;Digital systems;Hardware;Humans;Integrated circuit technology;Marketing and sales","circuit CAD;logic CAD;software engineering;systems analysis","classical system implementation tasks;co-design problems;computer aided design tools;concurrent design;design tradeoffs;digital component;digital hardware design;electronic systems;embedded software;hardware circuits;hardware/software co-design;integrated circuits;modern digital system design;product evolution;software application programs;system level objectives;systems on silicon","","","","81","1","120","","","20020806","","IEEE","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the irregular nature of memory accesses to graph data structures, parallelization of BFS on cache-based systems leads to poor performance. Many issues, such as memory access latency, cache coherence policy, and inter-process synchronization, affect the throughput performance of BFS on such systems. In our proposed message-passing multi-softcore architecture, parallelization is achieved by exchanging information among autonomous softcores on FPGA. Several optimizations are performed to reduce the traffic on the interconnect and to enable designs with high clock rates. Implementations on a state of the art FPGA achieve clock rates in excess of 100 MHz. The sustained performance of our system ranges from 160 to 795 Million Edges Per Second on a DDR3 DRAM. This result approaches the upperbound set by the DRAM bandwidth, and it rivals the best performance from implementations on various multi-core computing platforms.","","978-1-4244-8980-0","","10.1109/FPT.2010.5681757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681757","","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Field programmable gate arrays;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory;Synchronization","DRAM chips;cache storage;circuit optimisation;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;message passing;reconfigurable architectures;search problems","DDR3 DRAM;DRAM bandwidth;FPGA;breadth-first search graph problem;cache coherence policy;cache-based systems;graph data structures;inter-process synchronization;memory access latency;message-passing multisoftcore architecture;multicore computing platforms","","","","2","","16","","","20110106","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a simple task model is not directly applicable to modern embedded streaming applications. This is because a modern streaming application is typically modeled as a directed graph where nodes represent actors (i.e. tasks) and edges represent data-dependencies. The actors in such graphs have data-dependency constraints and do not necessarily conform to the periodic or sporadic task models. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the applicability of hard-real-time scheduling theory for periodic tasks to streaming applications modeled as acyclic Cyclo-Static Dataflow (CSDF) graphs. In such graphs, the actors are data-dependent, however, we analytically prove that they (i.e. the actors) can be scheduled as implicit-deadline periodic tasks. As a result, a variety of hard-real-time scheduling algorithms for periodic tasks can be applied to schedule such applications with a certain guaranteed throughput. We compare the throughput resulting from such scheduling approach to the maximum achievable throughput of an application for a set of 19 real streaming applications. We find that in more than 80% of the cases, the throughput resulting from our approach is equal to the maximum achievable throughput.","","978-1-4503-0714-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064526","Real-time multiprocessor scheduling;streaming applications","Equations;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules;Scheduling;Silicon;Vectors","data flow graphs;directed graphs;multiprocessing systems;processor scheduling","acyclic cyclo-static dataflow graphs;data-dependent task;directed graph;embedded streaming;hard-real-time scheduling;independent periodic task;multiprocessor system;sporadic task","","","","3","","","","","20111031","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

While research has been extensively conducted to solve those two problems, a gap between those two paradigms still exists. This paper presents an algorithm for architectural tradeoff for on-chip communication at operation-level granularity. Applied to practical Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and image processing applications, the algorithm can generate superior results over the state-of-the-art ones, while running in sub-quadratic time. Due to the low run time complexity, the algorithm is able to provide task-level applications with solutions that completely describe when and where operations and operands are executed and transferred, respectively. In practice, this opens an opportunity to substantially narrow the gap between high level and architecture level synthesis.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661536","","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Partitioning algorithms;Processor scheduling;Schedules;Scheduling","ant colony optimisation;computer architecture;high level synthesis;signal processing","DSP;architectural tradeoff;architecture level synthesis;architecture synthesis;digital signal processing;hierarchical ant-colony heuristic;high level synthesis;image processing applications;low run time complexity;on-chip communication;operation-level granularity;sub-quadratic time;task-level applications","","","","0","","","","","20131114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

By discussing the strengths and shortcomings of TL modeling we derive a set of requirements for a future modeling paradigm, which led to the new data flow abstraction approach presented in this paper.
