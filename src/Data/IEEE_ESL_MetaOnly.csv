In these applications, incorporating prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques provide systems with capabilities to self assess performance, determine the advent of failure and mitigate system risks. However, the prognostics problem for electronic systems is still approached from a component-centric-view. Extending a component-centric approach to an electronic system becomes complex and is often not worth the cost of pursuit due to the imbalance between scalability and efficiency of the prognostics approach. In order to address this problem, we propose a circuit-centric approach as an alternative method for realizing prognostics at an electronic system-level. The proposed approach is developed from the idea of decomposing a system into multiple critical circuits, and exploiting the parameters specific to the system's circuitries for predicting failure. Furthermore, a method is developed for detecting the gradual degradation of an electronic system by defining a health indicator to represent the system's health state at any given time. In this paper, we provide a formulation of the electronic system-level prognostics problem and demonstrate the approach on an electronic system for filtering analog signals.","","978-1-4673-5722-7","","10.1109/ICPHM.2013.6621432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621432","circuit failure prediction;circuit-centric apporach;electronic system prognostics","Band-pass filters;Circuit faults;Degradation;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Prognostics and health management;Testing","analogue circuits;failure analysis;network analysis;signal processing","analog signal filtering;circuit-centric approach;component-centric approach;electronic system- level prognostics;electronic system-level diagnostics;failure;health indicator;health state;multiple critical circuits","","","","0","","","","","20131007","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This design methodology is commonly referred to Electronic System Level (ESL) design. Simultaneously, dependability of embedded systems becomes a major concern. To satisfy these demands already at ESL, we present a dependability analysis approach working directly at this level. The approach analyzes the effectiveness of dependability measures in SystemC-based virtual prototypes. Errors are injected into SystemC transactions using an XML-based configuration mechanism. This is combined with the specification of the expected behavior with respect to the injected errors. The developed analysis approach allows for validation of dependability measures as well as localization of missing or buggy measures.

We also implement the TLM interface for external modules to communicate with the host virtual platform. Furthermore, the proposed virtual platform is capable of running multiple applications with dynamic loading of application programs in run time. That means the multiple applications could execute sequentially without pre-loading all programs when initialized. The virtual platform with 4 SPARC cores can execute up to 1605.88K cycles per second on a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo machine.

Minimal modifications, in the form of two parallel processes, were introduced to map the ANSI-C code to the Input/Output interface of a cardbus-based field-programmable gate array prototyping board. The remaining part of the code was directly synthesized to gates using Cebatech's C2R compiler and a number of configurations were studied with various degrees of functional-unit sharing and capabilities. Preliminary results clearly identify the potential of next generation ESL tools in transforming control-oriented applications written in ANSI-C code directly to synthesizable verilog, in record time. At the same time, the generated silicon exhibits up to two orders of magnitude better cycle performance compared to the Softfloat standard executing on an in-order superscalar processor (simulated) thus making a strong statement for the suitability of the ESL tool for the silicon synthesis of control-dominated applications.

In this work, we discuss the challenges of the multi- and many-core design-space.

In abstractions like the Register Transfer Level (RTL) or the gate level, cone of influence analysis is simple. However, the introduction of higher levels of abstractions, particularly the Electronic System Level (ESL), made it significantly harder to reliably extract a cone of influence. In this paper, we propose a methodology that enables cone of influence analysis at the ESL. Instead of a structural analysis, a behavioral scheme is proposed, i.e. stimuli representing different system executions are analyzed. To this end, machine learning techniques are exploited. This enables a very good approximation of the desired cone of influence which is non-invasive, does not rely on the availability of the source code, and performs fast. Case studies confirm the applicability of the proposed approach.","","","","10.1109/DSD.2013.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6628330","Cone of Influence;ESL;Machine Learning;SystemC","Approximation methods;Availability;Decision trees;Entropy;Libraries;Logic gates;Machine learning algorithms","electronic engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);logic gates","ESL;RTL;behavioral scheme;circuit signal;cone-of-influence analysis;design tasks;electronic system level;gate level;machine learning;noninvasive cone-of-influence approximation;register transfer level;source code;system executions","","","","0","","","","","20131015","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

SoCs are increasingly complex and heterogeneous systems that are highly integrated comprising processors, caches, hardware accelerators, memories, peripherals and interconnects. Modern SoCs deploy not only simple buses but also crossbars and Networks-on-Chip (NoC) to connect dozens or even hundreds of modules. However, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these interconnects because of their complexity. This is a potential design risk. In order to address this challenge, early design space exploration is required to find appropriate system architectures out of many candidate architectures. An appropriate interconnect architecture is a fundamental outcome of these evaluations since its latency and throughput characteristics affect the performance of all attached modules in the SoC. In this paper we show how to perform early design space exploration using our Electronic System Level (ESL) performance evaluation framework SystemQ. We use a heterogeneous MultiProcessor SoC that features a complex NoC as a central interconnect.

Furthermore, the transaction-level model (TLM) can satisfy the requests on complex design with relative high simulation speed and well performance evaluation. In this paper, we implement a TLM-based network-on-chip (NoC) platform and share-bus system architecture with SystemC.

This paper presents a resource-efficient architecture for the design of Otsu's thresholding algorithm and its implementation in field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed architecture is implemented for a 640x480 size of input image that is captured by a real-time high-resolution analog camera and buffered in a DDR2 SDRAM memory. The computation of between-class variance in Otsu's algorithm requires the evaluation of a normalized cumulative histogram, mean and cumulative moments, which need single-cycle read-modify-write operations. These operations are achieved by incorporating the FPGA's slices, dual-port Block RAM memories and DSP slices with DDR2 SDRAM as a frame buffer. The data path of the architecture is fixed-point arithmetic based and it does not require any divider.

Native co-simulation has been proposed as a fast solution for evaluating systems in early design steps. Annotated SW execution can be performed in conjunction with a virtual model of the HW platform to generate a complete system simulation. To obtain sufficiently accurate performance estimations, the effect of all the system components, as processor caches, must be considered. ISS-based cache models slow down the simulation speed, greatly reducing the efficiency of native-based co-simulations. To solve the problem, cache modeling techniques for fast native co-simulation have been proposed, but only considering instruction-caches. In this paper, a fast technique for data-cache modeling is presented, together with the instrumentation required for its application in native execution. The model allows the designer to obtain cache hit/miss rate estimations with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude with respect to ISS. Miss rate estimation error remains below 5% for representative examples.","2153-6961","978-1-4244-7515-5","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722227","Cache modelling;Electronic System Level;Embedded SW","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Data models;Embedded systems;Estimation;Memory management","cache storage;embedded systems;multiprocessing systems","complete system simulation;data-cache modeling;multiprocessor embedded systems;native co-simulation","","","","4","","25","","","20110303","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Productivity is enforced with HighLevel Synthesis (HLS) and Electronic System Level (ESL) design methodologies, that offer an efficient abstraction level to boost-up early prototyping. This paper presents a methodology and the required tool flow for the design of a System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, as a reference for modern control applications. The advantages of the proposed methodology are: (a) improved performance through hardware acceleration of demanding application cores, (b) improved quality of results with floating point calculations, (c) flexibility and integration of common peripheral devices supported by a RISC microcontroller and (d) improved designer productivity by avoiding Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and other time consuming and error introducing procedures and working with C level design descriptions only.

In Virtual Platform System (VPS), multi-level abstraction models should be properly adopted to achieve higher simulation performance while maintaining the platform design efforts as minimal as possible. For architecture validation, cycle-accurate system-level IP models are required to produce accurate performance simulation results. However, cycle-accurate model description often results in long modeling time and cycle inaccuracy due to complex timing behavior of given IPs. Therefore, RTL co-simulation has been widely used to avoid cycle-accurate model creation in system-level design process. In this paper, we suggest the Hybrid Virtual Platform System (H-VPS) to accelerate simulation speed by adopting co-emulation scheme into VPS while keeping cycle accuracy and minimizing risk of model creation.

Raising the abstraction level leads to reduced complexity compared to classical RTL modeling; however, due to this lack of detail, verification of higher level models produces new problems. Assertion based verification (ABV) - a well established RTL methodology - is a good example of this. Temporal relations in RTL properties are specified in terms of clocks that trigger the design. It is not obvious how to specify properties for more abstract, non-clocked models where the notion of lime is annotated as estimated delay values or omitted completely. Since ABV has already shown to be a strong methodology for functional RTL verification, we expect the same benefit for TL by lifting current ABV approaches to a higher level. In this paper we present a prototypic formal framework for specifying TL properties. We focus our work on three TL model views, as defined in the OSCI TLM standard. For each view we describe the model of computation and derive the required operators. Furthermore, we explain the required execution semantics and give some application examples","","1-4244-0421-5","","10.1109/MEMCOD.2006.1695910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1695910","","Clocks;Computational modeling;Delay effects;Delay estimation;Hardware;Process design;Prototypes;Runtime;System-level design;Timing","formal verification;hardware-software codesign","abstraction level;assertion based verification;electronic system level;execution semantics;formal framework;hardware design;hardware verification;multiabstraction TLM assertions;temporal relations;transaction level properties specification","","","","4","","20","","","20060911","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aiming to bring a solution, several techniques have appeared as alternatives to verify that a circuit description meets the requirements of its corresponding functional specification. Simulation is widely applied due to its convenience to uncover early design bugs, but is far from providing the exhaustiveness acquired through formal methods, for which improved and new tools continue to appear. On the other hand, formal verification can suffer from problems such as state-space explosion or modeling inaccuracy. Then, it is vital to develop new ways to check a design for consistency fast and comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a sequential equivalence checking (SEC) formalism and an algorithm, for use between a specification, written at electronic system level (ESL), and an implementation, written at RTL. Given that equivalence is checked between different levels of abstraction, it is no longer valid to perform SEC on single states, thus, we show a scheme to extract and compare complete sequences of states in order to determine if the design intention, which is described in the ESL specification, is contained and respected by the RTL implementation. The results obtained suggest that our methodology can be applied efficiently on real designs.","","978-1-4799-0595-9","","10.1109/LATW.2013.6562666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562666","RTL implementation;equivalence checking;formal methods;high-level specification","","formal verification","ESL specification;RTL hardware design;behavioral inconsistency;digital application complexity;electronic system level;formal equivalence checking;formal verification;functional specification;modeling inaccuracy;register transfer level;sequential equivalence checking formalism;state space explosion","","","","0","","16","","","20130718","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the underlying constraint-solver is based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and hence suffers from memory problems. In this paper, we propose the integration of new techniques for stimuli generation based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).

As a case study the proposed method has been used to model 32-bit C*CORE CPU and C*Core Local Bus (CLB).

Even though most state-of-the-art commercial tools have tried very hard to provide all the levels of details to satisfy the different requirements of the software designer, the hardware designer, and even the system architect, the hardware/software co-simulation speed is dramatically slow when co-simulating the hardware models at the register-transfer level (RTL) with a full-fledged operating system (OS). Our experimental results show that the combination of QEMU and SystemC can make the co-simulation at the CA level much faster than the conventional RTL simulation, even with a full-fledged operating system up and running. Furthermore, the statistics indicate that with every instruction executed and every memory accessed since power-on traced at the CA level, it takes 28m15.804s on average to boot up a full-fledged Linux kernel, even on a personal computer. Compared to the kernel boot time reported by Xilinx and SiCortex, the proposed CA-ISS is about 6.09 times faster compared to “SystemC without trace” of Xilinx and about 30.32 times faster compared to “SystemC models converted from RTL” of SiCortex. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) a hardware/software co-simulation environment capable of running a full-fledged OS at the early stage of the electronic system level design flow at an acceptable simulation speed is proposed; 2) a virtual platform constructed using the proposed CA-ISS as the processor model can be used to estimate the performance of a target system from system perspective, which all the previous works, such as QEMU-SystemC, do not provide; and 3) such a virtual platform also provides the modeling capability from the transaction level down to the CA level or the other way around.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2010.2095631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5737847","Cycle-accurate simulation;ISS;QEMU;SoC;hardware/software co-simulation;systemC","Data mining;Estimation;Hardware;Linux;Pipelines;Software;System-on-a-chip","Linux;hardware-software codesign;instruction sets;integrated circuit design;system-on-chip","CA level;CA-ISS;OS;QEMU;RTL;RTL simulation;SiCortex;SoC development;SystemC-based cycle-accurate ISS;Xilinx;cycle-accurate instruction set simulator;electronic system level design flow;full-fledged Linux kernel;full-fledged operating system;hardware designer;hardware-software cosimulation speed;performance estimation;personal computer;processor model;register-transfer level;software designer;system architect;system-on-chip development;virtual platform","","","","4","","47","","","20110322","","IEEE","IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It will be the key-issue of ESL methodology. It might be tightly related with software architecture and it is different point of view from typical upstream design of hardware. We developed ESL based simulation environment for modeling logic SoC used in mobile phones at the upstream design phase (during planning phase, before logic design).

Productivity is enforced with High-Level Synthesis (HLS) or Electronic System Level (ESL) or C-based hardware design methodologies, that offer an efficient abstraction level to boost-up early prototyping. However, just like the migration from schematics to Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) required specific coding styles for efficient hardware design, C-based hardware design also requires efficient coding guidelines to be followed. This paper presents a set of such coding guidelines, and evaluates their efficiency for FPGA based scientific, floating point arithmetic calculations. As found through extensive experimentation, the performance and area optimizations offered by efficient coding can improve the ones offered by HLS only, even more than 90%. So, while not every C program can be turned into hardware with the press of a button, efficient coded C programs can offer a profitable productivity boost.","","","","10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701691","","Adders;Algorithm design and analysis;Encoding;Field programmable gate arrays;Guidelines;Hardware;Optimization","C language;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;floating point arithmetic;hardware description languages;high level synthesis;medical signal processing","C level hardware design;C program;C-based hardware design method;ESL;FPGA based scientific floating point arithmetic calculations;FPGA device;GFLOP;HDL;HLS;abstraction level;area optimization;coding guidelines;computational complexity;early prototyping;electronic system level;embedded system design;field programmable gate array;floating point biomedical DSP application;hardware description language;high-level synthesis;power efficiency;productivity;time-to-market schedule","","","","0","","","","","20140109","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, often this is not an issue, since simulation execution appears to be deterministic due to deterministic SystemC scheduler implementations. However, to satisfy the increasing need for simulation speed, parallel SystemC engines are being researched: With no fixed strict total order among LPs executed in parallel, nondeterministic behavior is more likely to surface and more difficult to debug, threatening the viability to use simulation especially for debugging use-cases. This work presents a new method to test for nondeterminism: Anomalies are detected by running a simulation twice in sequential simulation mode while systematically varying the PEO, and without the need for source code analysis.

"ESL - the next leadership opportunity for India?","Naumann, Alan","","VLSI Design, 2005. 18th International Conference on","3-7 Jan. 2005","2005","","","26","","Summary form only given. This paper lectures on the increasingly critical role played by electronic system level (ESL) design tools in the development of the complex system-on-chip (SoC) devices that are now the indispensable engines of advanced consumer and communications products. Drawing upon his experience in managing CoWare, which has world-class software development resources in India, the author argues that ESL tool development expertise can be an effective differentiator for Indian software engineering. This paper discusses the growing impact of SoC technology on the global electronics market, and the factors driving it. In particular, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the design cost per gate continues to fall - because rising mask costs are more than offset by the massive increase in the number of gates per chip. This increase in gate capacity presents SoC designers not only with a significant market opportunity, but also with a serious design challenge - how to integrate so much functionality into one chip without the multiple re-spins that destroy a product's time to market and bury its design budget. Also discussed is the ESL design methodology, and it is argued that the adoption of such a methodology is a pre-requisite for meeting this SoC design challenge. This paper argues that Indian engineers - with their proven expertise in software modelling and development - can occupy a pole position in this new industrial revolution.","1063-9667","0-7695-2264-5","","10.1109/ICVD.2005.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383245","","Consumer electronics;Costs;Engineering drawings;Engineering management;Engines;Programming;Resource management;Software development management;Software engineering;System-on-a-chip","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit technology;software engineering;system-on-chip","ESL design methodology;India;Indian software engineering;SoC design;SoC technology;complex system-on-chip devices;electronic system level design tools;embedded systems;global electronics market;leadership opportunity","","","","0","","","","","20050124","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) is state-of-the-art for describing complex communication without all the details. As ESL language, SystemC has become the de facto standard. Since the SystemC TLM models are used for early software development and as reference for hardware implementation their correct functional behavior is crucial. Admittedly, the best possible verification quality can be achieved with formal approaches. However, formal verification of TLM models is a hard task. Existing methods basically consider local properties or have extremely high run-time. In contrast, the approach proposed in this paper can verify “true” TLM properties, i.e. major TLM behavior like for instance the effect of a transaction and that the transaction is only started after a certain event can be proven. Our approach works as follows: After a fully automatic SystemC-to-C transformation, the TLM property is mapped to monitoring logic using C assertions and finite state machines. To detect a violation of the property the approach uses a BMC-based formulation over the outermost loop of the SystemC scheduler. In addition, we improve this verification method significantly by employing induction on the C model forming a complete and efficient approach. As shown by experiments state-of-the-art proof techniques allow proving important non-trivial behavior of SystemC TLM designs.","","978-1-4244-7885-9","978-1-4244-7886-6","10.1109/MEMCOD.2010.5558643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558643","","Monitoring;Object oriented modeling;Resumes;Safety;Time domain analysis;Time varying systems;Unified modeling language","C++ language;digital systems;discrete event simulation;electronic engineering computing;finite state machines","abstract models;electronic system level design;finite state machines;monitoring logic;system level properties;transaction level modeling;untimed SystemC TLM designs","","","","3","","24","","","20100826","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is considered appropriate to specify abstract systems. To support the gap between UML and low level hardware descriptions, a few pilot tools and methodologies were proposed by both the EDA community and the academia. However, these tools either lack support for cycle accurate system specifications in UML or ignore the efficiency issue in cycle accurate system specifications based on UML. In this paper, an improved method is proposed to efficiently specify systems at cycle accuracy by significantly simplifying clock control modelling. This method is further supported by an improved translator to convert UML 2.0 specifications into executable SystemC descriptions. We believe that our method would be a significant contribution to the electronic system level (ESL) tools.","","978-0-7695-3006-2","","10.1109/IPC.2007.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438443","","Bridges;Clocks;Embedded system;Hardware;Microelectronics;Pervasive computing;Process design;Sequential circuits;System-level design;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;formal verification;hardware description languages;logic design;sequential circuits","UML 2.0 modelling;Unified Modelling Language;cycle accurate system specification;cycle accurate verification;electronic system level tools;embedded systems;executable SystemC description;low level hardware description;synchronous sequential circuit;system-level design","","","","0","","6","","","20080122","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new power consumption estimation methodology for embedded systems is proposed. First, the Functional Level Power Analysis (FLPA) is used to set up generic power models based on real board measurements. In the second step, a simulation framework is developed to evaluate accurately the architectural parameters of the elaborated power models. The proposed methodology has several benefits: it improves significantly the accuracy of the functional level approach and the power consumption estimation can be accomplished without a costly and complex material. In order to speed up the estimation process, our methodology refers to the selection of data pattern size and to the application sampling technique.

Current paper presents an automated approach to correcting system-level designs. We propose dynamic-slicing and location-ranking-based method for accurately pinpointing the error locations combined with a dedicated set of mutation operators for automatically proposing corrections to the errors. In order to validate the approach, experiments on the Siemens benchmark set have been carried out.

This paper presents a new out-of-order simulator for multi-core parallel DE simulation of hardware/software designs at any abstraction level. By localizing the simulation time and carefully handling events at different times, a system model can be simulated following a partial order of time. Subject to automatic static data analysis at compile time and table-based decisions at run time, threads can be issued early which reduces the idle time of available cores.

However, there often exists a gap between control engineering and system design. The control engineer has detailed knowledge about the algorithms but is abstracting from the system architecture and implementation. On the other hand, the system designer aims at achieving high-quality implementations based on quality constraints specified by the control engineer. This may result in either an overdesigned system in case the specifications are pessimistic or an unsafe system behavior when specifications are too optimistic. Thus, future design automation approaches have to consider the quality of control applications both as design objectives and design constraints to achieve safe yet highly optimized system implementations. The work at hand introduces an automatic tool flow at the Electronic System Level (ESL) that enables the optimization of a system implementation with quality of control being introduced as a principal design objective, like the maximum braking distance, while respecting constraints like maximum slip to ensure maneuverability of a car. The gap between mathematically well-defined models for system synthesis and common analysis techniques for control quality is bridged by co-simulation: A SystemC-based virtual prototype of a distributed controller implementation is combined with high-level models of the plants specified in Matlab/Simulink. Through a model transformation, the traditional development process of control applications is combined with state-of-the-art ESL techniques, ensuring model consistency while enabling a high degree of automation.","","978-1-4673-2295-9","978-1-4673-2296-6","10.1109/SAMOS.2012.6404200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404200","","Actuators;Delay;MATLAB;Sensors","braking;control engineering;control system synthesis;embedded systems;networked control systems;optimisation;virtual prototyping","Matlab;Simulink;SystemC-based virtual prototype;automatic tool flow;common analysis techniques;control applications;control engineering;control system design;cosimulation approach;design automation approaches;distributed controller implementation;electronic system level;embedded control systems;high-quality implementations;maximum braking distance;maximum slip;modern networked embedded systems;optimized system implementations;principal design objective;quality constraints;state-of-the-art ESL techniques;system architecture;system synthesis;system-level analysis;unsafe system behavior","","","","0","","21","","","20130110","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

To take up this challenge, system level design solutions have been set up, but many efforts have still to be done on system modelling and synthesis. In this paper we propose a computation core synthesis methodology that can be integrated on the communication refinement steps of electronic system level design tools. In the proposed approach, computation cores used for digital signal processing application specifications relying on coarse grain communications and synchronizations (e.g. matrix) can be refined into computation cores which can handle fine grain communications and synchronizations (e.g. scalar). Its originality is its ability to synthesize computation cores which can handle fine grain data consumptions and productions which respect the intrinsic partial orders of the algorithms while preserving their original functionalities. Such cores can be used to model fine grain input output overlapping or iteration pipelining. Our flow is based on the analysis of a fine grain signal flow graph used to extract fine grain synchronizations and algorithmic expressions","","0-7695-2609-8","","10.1109/DSD.2006.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1690046","","Digital signal processing;Integrated circuit technology;Moore's Law;Pipeline processing;Production;Productivity;Signal analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Signal synthesis;System-level design","digital signal processing chips;electronic engineering computing;high level synthesis;integrated circuit design","Moore law formulation;coarse grain communication refinement;computation core synthesis;digital signal processing algorithm;electronic system level design solution;grain synchronization;integrated circuits","","","","0","","9","","","20061016","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

ESL verification methodology is employed in the design regression of EPC C1Gen2 RFID tag. Around 200 times speedup is observed using ESL over conventional RTL simulation in regression runs (after logic bug fixes). This clearly shows ESL verification is a successful candidate to reuse high-level test harness for IC functional verification, especially in today's increasingly complex IC design world. On top of the successful use of the ESL functional verification flow on the design, we also show the infrastructure to use SystemC Verification Library (SCV) for formal verification. The functional and formal verification combined is thus the proposed ESL verification methodology.","","978-1-4244-5765-6","978-1-4244-5767-0","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419778","","Circuit testing;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Formal verification;Hardware design languages;Integrated circuit testing;Libraries;Programmable logic arrays;RFID tags;Timing","field programmable gate arrays;formal verification;integrated circuit design;logic design;logic simulation;radiofrequency identification;radiofrequency integrated circuits","EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID tag design;ESL verification methodology;FPGA;IC design;IC functional verification;OSCI TLM 2.0 Library;SystemC verification library;electronic system level;field programmable gate arrays;formal verification;high-level-C++ system simulation model;register transfer level","","","","2","","23","","","20100225","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the main components of the long turn-around-time for closing power is generating activity files at gate level or at register-transfer-level (RTL) to analyze the power. This paper describes a method to reduce the power-analysis run time multiple orders of magnitude maintaining gate-level power-analysis accuracy. To reduce the run-time dramatically for power analysis, novel activity-propagation and port-mapping algorithms to convert automatically from electronic-system-level (ESL) activity file to RTL vcd (value change dump) file and to gate-level vcd file have been proposed. After obtaining all vcd files in each level, we can do power analysis without accuracy degradation at RTL and at gate level. In this method, a huge amount of run time for simulation in each level is reduced. By analyzing a variety of digital circuits, we demonstrate the run-time of our methodology is an order of magnitude faster than traditional method at RTL and multiple orders of magnitude faster at gate level with less than 1% accuracy degradation of RTL and gate-level power analysis.","","978-1-4244-5034-3","978-1-4244-5035-0","10.1109/SOCDC.2009.5423822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5423822","","Algorithm design and analysis;Circuits;Computational modeling;Degradation;Design engineering;Humans;Personal digital assistants;Power engineering and energy;Runtime;Very large scale integration","integrated circuit design;logic design","VLSI design;activity propagation algorithm;digital circuits;electronic system level activity;gate level power analysis accuracy;inter-hierarchical power analysis methodology;port mapping algorithm;register transfer level;value change dump file","","","","1","","","","","20100304","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

As new generations of technology have become accessible, die dimensions and clock frequencies have increased causing ever-larger switching currents to be drawn from the power supply. Interconnections routed at the chip level, bonding wires and package frames act as antennas that cause parasitic radiation (IC radiated emissions) while radio frequency (RF) currents that superimpose the nominal currents (power and signal currents) at the IC ports drive the unintentional emissions of printed circuit board (PCB) traces (IC-conducted emissions). Recognizing the importance of IC EMEs, equipment manufacturers are beginning to require semiconductor companies to specify the IC emission levels. For these reasons, research activities in the field of characterization techniques of ICs in terms of EMEs are receiving increasing attention, and several methods have been proposed to measure the EMC performances of ICs. A new method to measure IC-conducted EMEs using a backward-wave (BW) directional coupler is presented in this paper. The coupler consists of two-coupled microstrip lines employed to measure the spectrum of the current delivered through IC pins with low invasiveness and high repeatability. The operation principle of the method is described and the design criteria for the coupler are given. The results of experimental tests performed using the coupler are compared with those obtained with a standard technique to prove the effectiveness of the method.","0018-9456","","","10.1109/TIM.2010.2047970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462860","Electromagnetic compatibility;emission;integrated circuits (ICs);microstrip directional couplers;standardization","","directional couplers;electromagnetic compatibility;integrated circuit bonding;integrated circuit measurement;microstrip lines;monolithic integrated circuits;printed circuits","EMC;IC emission levels;IC-conducted emissions;backward-wave directional coupler;electromagnetic emissions;electronic system level;integrated circuits;parasitic radiation;power supply;printed circuit board;radio frequency currents;switching currents","","","","1","","11","","2010-05-10","20100607","","IEEE","IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since most of these tools are not compatible with PLC development environments, custom translating software built by using standard compiler techniques, can be employed for converting PLC programs to a form that can be understood by the selected tools. Furthermore, the translating software uses different coding templates to support microarchitectural level design trade-offs.

In the early stages of this flow, the Electronic System Level (ESL) description style, and languages such as SystemC TLM, enable high-level debugging of the SoC functionality. In the last stages, hardware blocks become RTL or gate level (VHDL or Verilog) descriptions. We have developed two autonomous Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) solutions, for SystemC TLM platforms and for VHDL/Verilog IP blocks: designs are automatically instrumented with ad hoc property checkers produced from requirements formalized as PSL assertions. Furthermore, for a comprehensive and seamless verification flow, analogous requirements should be verifiable before and after ESL-to-RTL hardware refinement. This requires the transformation of ESL assertions into their counterparts at the RT level. This paper discusses this issue and proposes a first set of transformation rules for the automatic refinement of PSL assertions from the system level to the signal level.

Experience on a wide variety of SoC designs has shown that significant increases in SoC performance and reduction in energy consumption are possible through the use of tuned Application-Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs), along with the right choices of interconnect structures and associated hardware blocks. This embedded tutorial introduces the audience to the concept of ASIPs and uses practical examples to illustrate how ASIP architectures can be mapped to applications.

However, analogue technology models comprise too many details to be usable at system level as the simulation time would be far to high compared to traditional Transaction Level Modelling (TLM) models. In this paper we illustrate different aspects of using analogue line models as a transmission method for transactions between TLM models. This includes the introduction of analogue signal paths for TLM models and how to avoid the simulation time penalty of analogue technology models.

To address these demands, design at the Electronic System Level (ESL) has been introduced. SystemC currently is the “defacto standard” for ESL design. The extraction of data from system designs written in SystemC is thereby crucial e.g. for the proper understanding of a given system. However, no satisfactory support of reflection/introspection of SystemC has been provided yet. Previously proposed methods for this purpose either focus on static aspects only, restrict the language means of SystemC, or rely on modifications of the compiler and/or parser. In this work, we present an approach that overcomes these limitations. A methodology is introduced which enables full extraction of the desired information from a given SystemC design without changing the SystemC library or the compiler. For this purpose, debug symbols generated by the compiler and SystemC API calls are exploited. The proposed system retrieves both, static and dynamic information. A comparison to previously proposed solutions shows the benefits of the proposed method, while its application is illustrated by means of a visualization engine.","2159-3469","","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2013.6654618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654618","","Adders;Data mining;Hardware;Information retrieval;Libraries;Software systems;Standards","C language;application program interfaces;hardware-software codesign;program debugging","ESL;SystemC API;SystemC design;compiler;data extraction;debug symbol;electronic system level;hardware-software codesign;static aspect;visualization engine","","","","0","","","","","20131107","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional technology scaling of semiconductor chips followed Moore's Law. However, the transistor performance improvement will be limited, and designer will not see doubling of frequency every two years. Recently, three-dimension integrated circuits (3D IC) that employ the vertically through-silicon vias (TSVs) for connecting each of dies have been proposed. It is an alternative solution to existent Package-on-Package (PoP) and System-in-Package (SiP) processes. There are many benefits by using TSV-based 3-D integration technologies: (1) more functionality can be integrated into a small silicon space for form factor reduction, (2) circuit delay can be improved by using TSVs due to the shorter interconnect and reduced parasitic capacitance/inductance, (3) different components with incompatible manufacturing process (i.e. Logic, DRAM, Flash, etc) can be combined in single 3-D IC for heterogeneous integration. In addition, there are many 3-D multi-core or many-core architectures are discussed recently. Comparing with traditional two-dimension multi-core or many-core architectures, the major difference is memory bandwidth problem can be addressed by stacked memory architecture. Intel has good demonstration through the teraflops microprocessor chip which is an 80-core design with memory-on-logic architecture. And, each core connects to a 256KB SRAM with 12GB/s bandwidth. Although 3-D stacking technology can bring us many benefits for next generation integrated circuits, it comes with many problems and challenges in system-level design. For instance, 3-D IC designs will deal with serious challenges in design space exploration and system validation. For most designs, the number of TSV will be the most critical limitation that should be considered carefully. Besides, system design by 3-D IC will become more and more complex, and it needs a full system-level solution to face the performance, number of TSV, and power issues of 3D-IC. Furthermore, i- - t is more challenge to provide a FPGA-based prototyping system for early-stage software development. In general, the continue increasing complexity of modern SoC or embedded system design is also extreme. To achieve the required design productivity for the time-to-market pressure, a common accepted solution is using electronic system-level (ESL) design methodology to design the system in the different design abstraction level. One of the key technologies of ESL solution is to construct the HW/SW co-simulation platform by using the virtual prototyping concept. Moreover, designers need a multiphase of virtual platform construction to meet the different targets of design stage, such as early system validation and architecture exploration. In this work, we create a simulation framework by using ESL methodology to explore 3-D IC system that consists of multi-core processors with extended stacking memory. To demonstrate our 3-D IC design techniques, the stacking memory approach is employed in our “3D-PAC (Parallel Architecture Core)” design. In 3D-PAC, we stack SRAM directly on top of the logic die which is heterogeneous multi-core computing platform for multimedia application purpose. The logic die is mainly consists of a general-purpose microprocessor, dual programmable digital signal processor (DSP) cores, AXI/AHB/APB subsystems, and various peripherals. Furthermore, we had the corresponding virtual platform (PAC Duo virtual platform) which had been used for early architecture exploration, power estimation and HW/SW co-simulation. The difference with PAC Duo design, the target of 3D-PAC is to provide a three-dimensional SoC (3-D SoC) design exporation for media-rich and multi-function portable devices. Although using the stacking memory approach with TSV technology can increase the capacity and performance of memory system significantly, but the placement and organization of the memory system are the nother important design issues.

To nail down these design errors early, a better debugging support of RTL memory on the software side is extremely useful. We present a just-in-time shadow memory technique that can allow debugging of RTL memory from a software perspective. While cosimulation is fast compared to a complete hardware based simulation, the communication and synchronization overhead between the hardware and software simulators can be very significant. Since the two simulators have to communicate almost every cycle, a good communication platform is necessary to reduce this extra overhead. To evaluate this overhead, we implement and evaluate three communication primitives for a real system design with ARM926EJ-Sprocessor and RTL memory.

Abstraction-based methodologies have been developed resulting in Electronic System Level (ESL) design. A prominent language for ESL design is SystemC offering different levels of abstraction, interoperability and the creation of very fast models for early software development. For the verification of SystemC models, Constrained Random Verification (CRV) plays a major role. CRV allows to automatically generate simulation scenarios under the control of a set of constraints. Thereby, the generated stimuli are much more likely to hit corner cases. However, the existing SystemC Verification library (SCV), which provides CRV for SystemC models, has several deficiencies limiting the advantages of CRV.

To avoid data hazards and ensure timing accuracy, this technique requires the compiler to statically analyze the design model for potential data access conflicts. In this paper, we propose a compiler optimization that improves the data conflict analysis by exploiting instance isolation.

Based on the simulation and analysis with the ViP, the software optimization could improve system performance by more than 50%.

We present a modeling library on top of SystemC, targeting heterogeneous embedded system design, based on four models of computation. The library has a formal basis where all elements are well defined and lead in construction of analyzable models. The semantics of communication and computation are implemented by the library, which allows the designer to focus on specifying the pure functional aspects.

But even if the complexity of the systems can be handled using the abstraction levels offered by TLM - the most abstract one is untimed and focuses on functionality - still verification is the major bottleneck. In particular, as untimed TLM models are the reference for the following refinement steps their correctness has to be ensured. Thus, formal verification approaches have been developed to prove properties for these models. However, even if several properties have been checked this does not guarantee that the complete functionality of the TLM model has been verified. Thus, in this paper we consider the problem of functional coverage analysis in formal TLM property checking. We present a coverage approach which can analyze whether the property set unambiguously describes all transactions in a SystemC TLM model. The developed coverage analysis method identifies uncovered scenarios and hence allows to close all coverage gaps.

Our experimental results based on applying the proposed methodology on the OpenRISC and MIPS processors demonstrate the usefulness of having multiple power models.

Quality Electronic Design","16-18 March 2009","2009","","","535","540","Electronic system level (ESL) is regarded as a necessary solution to deal with the ever increasingly complex system-on-chip (SoC) design. Most ESL designs are modeling at the C high-level language (no matter functional C or SystemC). Although some commercial products are partially available, the lack of directly translating C or SystemC into RTL becomes a main obstacle to a seamless ESL flow from high level abstraction through RTL and all the way to the final chip design. We propose an efficient semi-hardware description language called VeriC (Verilog and C) to bridge ESL and RTL. Like SystemC, VeriC is based on C++ and not only describes the design by a syntax very close to Verilog, but also it can model the target design at both pin and cycle accuracy with an implicit clock mechanism, a modeling way closer to Verilog. Those VeriC modules can be directly translatable to RTL and also can be interoperable with other modules in C/SystemC/Verilog languages by hybrid simulation. Our objective is not to replace SystemC, but to move the RTL model up to a higher level such that detailed cycle-accurate implementation can be present even in C-level simulation, a supplemental and more efficient approach for bridging the gap between ESL design and RTL models. Experimental results show that the VeriC simulation speed can be 2-10times faster than SystemC, because of the improvement in the simulation kernel (by taking advantages of input/output connections and a simpler cycle mechanism). It can also reach 10times-250times simulation speedup than Verilog in simulating the same behavior.","","978-1-4244-2952-3","978-1-4244-2953-0","10.1109/ISQED.2009.4810351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810351","Cycle/Pin accurate;Debugging interface;Fast Co-simulation;Fast ESL flow;Implicit clock;Semi-hardware description language","Bridges;Chip scale packaging;Clocks;Debugging;Electronic design automation and methodology;Hardware design languages;High level languages;Kernel;Runtime;Watches","C++ language;electronic engineering computing;hardware description languages;high level languages;open systems;system-on-chip","C high-level language;C++;C-level simulation;SoC;SystemC;VeriC;VeriC modules;Verilog;electronic system level;final chip design;hybrid simulation;semihardware description language;system-on-chip","","","","2","","7","","","20090403","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, today's system-level design methodologies usually focus on the abstraction of digital logic and time, so that typical low-power aspects cannot be considered so far. In this paper, we present a high-level modeling approach on top of the SystemC/TLM standard to simulate power distribution and voltage based implications in a ""loosely-timed"" functional execution context. The approach reuses legacy TLM models and prevents the need for detailed lock-step process synchronization in contrast to existing methods.

Therefore, low power optimization techniques are strongly applied during the development of modern application specific instruction set processors (ASIPs). Electronic system level design tools based on architecture description languages (ADL) offer a significant reduction in design time and effort by automatically generating the software tool-suite as well as the register transfer level (RTL) description of the processor. In this paper, the automation of power optimization in ADL-based RTL generation is addressed. Operand isolation is a well-known power optimization technique applicable at all stages of processor development. With increasing design complexity several efforts have been undertaken to automate operand isolation. In pipelined datapaths, where isolating signals are often implicitly available, the traditional RTL-based approach introduces unnecessary overhead. We propose an approach which extracts high-level structural information from the ADL representation and systematically uses the available control signals.

In this paper, to reduce power consumption of heterogeneous processor, a power management algorithm is proposed with a time-based power control architecture which autonomously performs voltage/clock scaling operations without the intervention of the processors. The proposed algorithm has adaptively adjusted time-threshold levels for voltage/clock control to minimize the power consumption and work in severe time-constraints for real-time processing. The real-time adjustment makes robust performance of the power consumption guarantee regardless of patterns of data traffic and diverse application programs.

Among various modeling technologies underlying ESL tools, synchronous dataflow (SDF) and its related models of computation have been successfully used to model and simulate many wireless standards. However, LTE physical layer involves dynamically varying data processing rates that make SDF insufficient due to its constant-rate constraint. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Mixed-mode Vector-based Dataflow (MVDF), to efficiently model and simulate LTE physical layer by exploring the matched-rate nature of LTE and by combining static and dynamic dataflow technologies. We have implemented MVDF in an ESL tool, called SystemVue, along with a complete LTE physical layer library. With the implementation, we are able to create LTE reference designs for performance measurements.

Also, there is yet to be a standard for applying IP power modelling that fits with a TLM terminology and into the overall system modelling process. Although power is hardly analyzed today even at the RTL level, “access” to power at the ESL domain may become much more critical, given the impact designers can have on power behaviour at this level. Ideally, software developers can also gain visibility into power dynamics and adjust their development flow to accommodate power guidelines, as well. With the current isolated HW and SW flows, this may seem unrealistic. What are some of the pitfalls of being “too early” in applying new technologies?

Particular strengths of Simulink are rapid design and algorithm exploration. Moreover, commercial tools are available to generate embedded C or HDL code directly from a Simulink model. On the other hand, Simulink models are purely functional models and, hence, designers cannot seamlessly consider the architecture that a Simulink model is later implemented on. In particular, it is not possible to explore the different architectural alternatives and investigate the arising interactions and side-effects directly within Simulink. To benefit from Matlab/Simulink's algorithm exploration capabilities and overcome the outlined drawbacks, this work introduces a model transformation framework that converts a Simulink model to an executable specification, written in an actor-oriented modeling language. This specification then serves as the input of well-established Electronic System Level (ESL) design flows that, e. g., enables Design Space Exploration (DSE) and automatic code generation for both hardware and software. We also present a validation technique that considers the functional correctness by comparing the original Simulink model with the generated specification in a co-simulation environment. The co-simulation can also be used to evaluate the performance of implementation candidates during DSE. As case study, we present and investigate a torque vectoring application from an electric automotive vehicle.","1636-9874","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6646658","Actor-oriented Design;Code Generation;DSE;Matlab/Simulink;System-level Validation;SystemC","Computational modeling;Generators;Hardware;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers);Registers;Software packages","","","","","","0","","","","","20131028","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to RTL, TL models (TLM) are more abstract and do not contain micro-architectural details for instance; the design focus is on high-level control and data flow. Since TLMs are essential at the decision process in early system development and as they can serve as golden reference models for later RTL regression, it is imperative to ensure that they implement the specification correctly.

This makes it challenging to develop reliable hardware through hand-crafted RTL implementations. The problem is exacerbated with aggressive time-to-market requirements, leading to a design productivity gap. Electronic System Level (ESL) design is often seen as a solution to this gap: the idea is to raise the design abstraction by specifying a hardware design behaviorally with a high-level language (e.g., SystemC).

According to SIGNAL's polychronous model of computation, we propose a model for AADL, which takes both software, hardware and allocation into account. This model enables an early phase timing analysis and synthesis via tools associated with Polychrony.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952285","AADL;Polychrony;Synthesis","Clocks;Computational modeling;Instruction sets;Processor scheduling;Timing","hardware description languages;high level synthesis","AADL language;SIGNAL synchronous language;abstraction level;electronic system design;formal framework;high-level analysis;high-level modeling;phase timing analysis;system complexity;system-level codesign;system-level synthesis;time to market constraint","","","","1","","23","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems can integrate many disparate computing elements, and often contain soft processors hosting application components. Soft processors are sequential, synchronous devices with low computational density, and are not capable of exploiting the concurrency available on the FPGA. We present a method for increasing the computational density of application-specific systems by eliminating soft processors within these systems. This method eliminates soft processors by replacing programs that would be hosted on soft processors with custom, self-contained, circuitizable finite-state machine with datapath (FSMD) components that are automatically generated. We show that FS-MDs produced using this method eliminate the computational overhead associated with fetching and decoding instructions. We further show that this method, when applied to interrupt-driven programs, can produce concurrent FSMDs that arbitrate for shared datapath resources. We discuss how these FSMDs are capable of leveraging the spatial computational capabilities of the FPGA and are therefore more aptly suited for deployment within application-specific systems. We show that these FSMDs eliminate overhead associated with interrupt context switching, decrease interrupt servicing latencies, and eliminate interrupt livelock. We discuss implications and limitations of this method, and describe a prototype that implements the method for programs targeted for the Intel 8051.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952293","automatic synthesis;behavioral synthesis;binary synthesis;compiler;embedded systems","Clocks;Design automation;Field programmable gate arrays;Instruction sets;USA Councils","field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;microprocessor chips","Intel 8051;application-specific systems;computational density;decoding instruction;fetching instruction;field programmable gate array;finite-state machine with datapath;interrupt-driven program;reconfigurable computing platform;soft processors hosting application","","","","0","","27","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cyber-physical systems (CPS), however, computation time is a correctness factor: missed deadlines for hard real-time applications, such as avionics and automobiles, can result in devastating, life-threatening consequences. Although many modern modeling languages for CPS include the notion of time, implementation languages such as C lack any temporal semantics. Consequently, models and programs for CPS are neither portable nor guaranteed to execute correctly on the real system; timing is merely a side effect of the realization of a software system on a specific hardware platform. In this position paper, we present the research initiative for a precision timed (PRET) infrastructure, consisting of languages, compilers, and microarchitectures, where timing is a correctness factor. In particular, the timing semantics in models and programs must be preserved during compilation to ensure that the behavior of real systems complies with models.

Modeling constructs, models of computation, and timing models at the system level need to be developed so that hardware and software can be uniformly modeled, and later partitioned after simulation based profiling. In this session, two papers will be presented, one on data structures for unified modeling, and another on a unified model of computation. The first paper describes a HW/SW codesign template library (CTL). It allows the usage of high level complex data structures for design space exploration by replacing complex data structures with specific library components for either HW or SW. For HW designs, the library provides the opportunity to map data structures to specific memory structures and it contributes to achieve an efficient memory usage. In the second paper, the authors propose a cyber physical system modeling approach based on process networks. The proposed approach supports Kahn process networks, timed dataflow and signal flow graphs as well as their interfacing. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness of this unified view of models of computation.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952278","","","","","","","","0","","","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent work has proposed distributing FPGA circuit applications in a SystemC bytecode to be emulated on a processor with portions possibly dynamically migrated to custom bytecode accelerator circuits or to native circuits on the FPGA. We introduce a novel JIT compiler for bytecode executing on a soft-core FPGA processor. During an iterative process of JIT compiler and emulator architecture codesign, we added JIT-aware resources on a soft-core processor's surrounding FPGA fabric, including a JIT memory, a signal queue, and an emulation memory controller - all unique to JIT compilation for FPGA processors versus traditional processors. Experiments show that regular JIT compilation achieved 3.0× average speedup over emulation, while our JIT-aware FPGA resources yielded an additional 5.2× average speedup, for a total of 15.7× average speedup, at a cost of 21% of a MicroBlaze processor core's slice usage.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952282","","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Emulation;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Random access memory;Software","electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;just-in-time;logic design;program compilers;random-access storage","JIT compiler;JIT memory;SystemC bytecode;emulation memory controller;emulator architecture codesign;just-in-time compilation;processor-independent instruction;signal queue;soft-core FPGA processor","","","","0","","25","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper targets system level throughput optimization in streaming pipelined MPSoCs under process variation. First, to maximize system level throughput, we make extensive use of data parallelism of the streaming applications to map them to multiple cores available on a chip. In order to tackle the effect of process variation in clock frequency of these cores, and the resulting deterioration in system timing yield, we propose to deploy frequency scaling and configuration selection for each core. We incorporate timing yield constraint during task replication and load balancing for data parallel tasks. The novel contribution of this work is that we perform all these operations simultaneously, and show the benefits of our approach. We present an ILP solution for maximum throughput under process variation and the proposed solution determines the right degree of parallelism at target timing yield. Our proposed ILP formulation is very generic and can be used for task replication of single or multiple tasks, while simultaneously performing optimum load balancing. The results show that the MPSoC system design flows that do not consider one or more than one of the above mentioned design decisions simultaneously, suffer greatly from the design failures and fail to meet strict timing yield and bandwidth constraints. The throughput of such an MPSoC system is also worse than half of the throughput of our proposed system.","2117-4628","978-1-4673-1630-9","978-2-9539987-7-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240584","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Equations;Parallel processing;Program processors;Throughput;Timing","integer programming;integrated circuit design;linear programming;system-on-chip","ILP formulation;MPSoC system design;clock frequency;configurable MPSoC;configuration selection;data parallel task;delay distribution;die-to-die variation;frequency scaling;optimum load balancing;process variation-aware task replication;streaming pipelined MPSoC;system level throughput optimization;system timing yield;target timing yield;within-die variation","","","","0","","9","","","20120716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, its application to HW/SW embedded system specification and design requires specific features not covered by the language. For this reason, the MARTE profile for Real-Time and Embedded systems was defined. It has proven to be powerful enough to support holistic system modeling under different views. This single-source model is able to capture the required information, enabling the automatic generation of executable and configurable models for fast performance analysis without requiring additional engineering effort. As a result of this performance analysis suitable system architecture can be decided. At this point, the SW stack to be executed by each processing node in the selected heterogeneous platform has to be generated. In the general case this is a tedious and error-prone process with little assistance from available tools. Current practices oblige the SW engineer to develop the code for each node of the heterogeneous multi-core platform by hand. The code has to be written specifically for the selected architecture and architectural mapping, thus reducing reusability. In order to overcome this limitation, the FP7 PHARAON project aims to develop tools able to automatically generate the code to be executed in each node from the initial system model. This affects not only the application code, the static and run-time libraries (e.g. OpenMP/OpenCL), the middleware and communication functions, but also the OS and the driver calls in each node.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573222","MARTE;MPSoC;SW synthesis;UML","Analytical models;Concurrent computing;Embedded systems;Object oriented modeling;Semantics;Standards;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;middleware;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","FP7 PHARAON project;HW-SW embedded system;MDE;MPSoC;OpenCL;OpenMP;UML-MARTE models;architectural mapping;driver calls;heterogeneous multicore platform;holistic system modeling;middleware;model driven engineering;multiprocessing system-on-chip;real time systems;software development;system synthesis","","","","0","","41","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The environment with which the cyber-physical device interacts, such as lungs for a medical ventilator device or a busy freeway for an autonomous vehicle, may be complex and subsequently difficult to explore all possible configurations. Computer simulations that utilize device and environment behavioral models may be used as a first stage of testing, but at some point development must occur using the real device running in real-time. We present a codesign framework for aiding cyber-physical device development where real devices or prototypes are connected to real-time models that simulate the interacting environment. Such test setups are known as digital mockups and allow for testing environment scenarios that are hard to capture with commonly-used but limited physical mockups. The framework supports model hardware/software codesign to enable models of varying speed and accuracy to be implemented within an embedded processor or as a custom coprocessor circuit on an FPGA. We describe an accompanying tool that generates code templates to reduce the time required to develop digital mockup test setups. We utilize the framework to build a digital mockup test setup for a commercial ventilator, and showcase codesign capabilities by implementing environmental models as both circuits and as instructions on a processor.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952295","Cyber-physical systems;codesign;coprocessor;digital mockups;modeling","Computational modeling;Coprocessors;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Transducers;Unified modeling language","application specific integrated circuits;coprocessors;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;medical computing","FPGA;application-specific codesign platform generation;commercial ventilator;coprocessor circuit;cyber-physical device development;cyber-physical systems;digital mockup test setup;hardware-software codesign","","","","1","","17","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

The formalism used here combines FSM's to encode overall structure, PSL-like properties to encode behavior within a state, and concepts of variables to make description more compact.

Much like application specific processors, our methodology starts from a known instruction set architecture and customizes it to create the final implementation. However, our approach goes further as we not only add custom functional units and define the parameters of the register file, but we also remove unneeded interconnect, which results in a data path that looks more similar to that created by high level synthesis tools. We show that there are substantial opportunities for eliminating unused resources, which results in an architecture that has significantly smaller area. We compare area, delay and performance results of a base architecture with trimmed one. Preliminary results show by only trimming wires we have an average of 25% area reduction while improving the performance around 5%.

Currently, the analysis is performed on the formal specifications through Boolean abstractions. Even though it is a sound abstraction, for more precise analysis we might have to refine the abstraction. Refining the abstraction level from pure Boolean to a theory of Integers can lead to more precise decisions. In this paper, we first show how integrating a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver to POLYCHRONY compiler can enhance its decision making capabilities. Further, we show, how a polyhedral analysis library integrated to the compiler, can compute safe operational boundaries, and filter unsafe input combinations to keep the system safe. We enhanced the POLYCHRONY compiler's ability to make more accurate decisions and to accept and characterize the safe input range for specifications where safety may be violated for a relatively small region of a large input space. The enhancement also allows the user to consider the severity of the violation with respect to entire space of inputs, and either reject a specification or synthesize a wrapped software with guaranteed safe operation.","2117-4628","978-1-4673-1630-9","978-2-9539987-7-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240593","","Abstracts;Analytical models;Clocks;Computational modeling;Libraries;Safety;Synchronization","decision making;formal specification;program compilers","Boolean abstractions;SMT solver;decision making capability;deterministic software synthesis;embedded software synthesis;formal specifications;integer theory;polychronous framework;polychrony compiler;polyhedral analysis library;safety wrappers;safety-critical cyber physical systems;satisfiability modulo theory;sound abstraction","","","","1","","17","","","20120716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a hierarchical scheduling algorithm using the ideas of ant colony, whose run time complexity is at the same scale as ordinary list scheduling, while generating results as good as the classic ant-colony scheduling algorithm. In practice, this implies a very substantial run-time improvement, enabling scheduling exploration of much larger problems while avoiding the pitfalls of over-constraint and lower quality results that hierarchical solutions are generally known for.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573217","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Schedules;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms","ant colony optimisation;microprocessor chips;processor scheduling","ant colony scheduling algorithm;list scheduling;run time complexity;scalable high quality hierarchical scheduling;scheduling exploration","","","","0","","16","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method first consists of deriving, from a Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) algorithm description, a Memory Exclusion Graph (MEG) that models all the memory objects of the application and their allocation constraints. Based on the MEG, memory allocation can be performed at three different stages of the implementation process: prior to the scheduling process, after an untimed multicore schedule is decided, or after a timed multicore schedule is decided. Each of these three alternatives offers a distinct trade-off between the amount of allocated memory and the flexibility of the application multicore execution. Tested use cases are based on descriptions of real applications and a set of random SDF graphs generated with the SDF For Free (SDF3) tool. Experimental results compare several allocation heuristics at the three implementation stages. They show that allocating memory after an untimed schedule of the application has been decided offers a reduced memory footprint as well as a flexible multicore execution.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573219","","Memory management;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Resource management;Runtime;Schedules;Timing","data flow graphs;multiprocessing systems;scheduling;storage allocation;system-on-chip","MEG;SDF For Free;SDF algorithm description;SDF3 tool;allocation heuristics;application multicore execution;memory allocation;memory exclusion graph;memory objects;multiprocessor system-on-chip;random SDF graphs;reduced memory footprint;shared memory MPSoC;synchronous dataflow","","","","0","","12","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Partial controller retiming in high-level synthesis","Sobue, R.; Hara-Azumi, Y.; Tomiyama, H.","Dept. of Electron. & Comput.

However, they focus only on the datapath and cannot handle the controller delay even though most critical paths lie across the controller and datapath (i.e., from state registers in the controller to storage units in the datapath) and the controller delay occupies the non-negligible portion of the paths. This paper proposes a novel HLS technique to remove such controller delays. Our method, “Register-Transfer (RT) level register retiming”, is applied to only parts of the control logic, which generate control signals of multiplexers (MUXs) on critical paths, in such a way that generates and stores the signals into registers in the previous cycle. It then lets the MUXs obtain their control signals directly from the registers, leading to reduction in critical path delay. Experiments on several benchmark programs demonstrate that our RT-level retiming can achieve comparable clock improvement while mitigating area overhead, compared with conventional gatelevel retiming.","","978-1-4673-6414-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573209","High-level synthesis;multiplexers;register retiming","Benchmark testing;Clocks;Delays;Hardware;Logic gates;Registers;Transform coding","clocks;high level synthesis;multiplexing equipment;optimisation","clock frequency;high-level synthesis;multiplexers;optimization techniques;partial controller retiming;register-transfer level","","","","0","","16","","","20130801","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A hardware/software codesign template library for design space exploration","Brunmayr, P.; Haase, J.; Grimm, C.","Inst. of Comput.

Thereby, low level tools can be utilized for accurate design parameter estimation, which helps to evaluate the effect of system level design decisions. Especially complex data structures pose a problem in this context. The different structure of memory in hardware and software requires different data structure implementations. With the presented data structure library a consistent design flow from a high level system model to either a hardware or software implementation is enabled. The concept extends the idea of abstract data types across the hardware/software boundary. Container adapters with appertaining implementations for system level simulation, hardware and software implementation support the designer throughout the whole design process. The benefit of the presented library is demonstrated and evaluated by a case study. With very little effort seven different hardware solutions were generated and compared concerning their power consumption and their resource usage.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952279","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952279","","Computational modeling;Containers;Data structures;Hardware;Libraries;Random access memory;Software","data structures;hardware-software codesign;memory architecture;resource allocation;systems analysis","complex data structure library;complex data structures;container adapters;cyber-physical system;design flow;design space exploration;hardware-software codesign template library;parameter estimation;power consumption;resource usage;system level design decision;system level simulation","","","","0","","15","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Enabling the synthesis of very long operation properties","Langer, J.; Horn, T.; Heinkel, U.","Chemnitz Univ. of Technol., Chemnitz, Germany","Electronic System Level Synthesis Conference (ESLsyn), 2011","5-6 June 2011","2011","","","1","6","In previous work, the high-level synthesis of operation properties has been proposed. In this work, we improve the existing algorithms in order to allow the synthesis of more efficient hardware models. Especially for very long properties no model could be generated before, because both the runtime of the synthesis process and the amount of used hardware resources were prohibitively high. The proposed improvements are threefold. First, the generated non-deterministic control automaton is replaced by a deterministic automaton using an optimized power set construction algorithm. This significantly reduces the number of registers in the generated model. Second, a property can contain local variables (freeze variables), that capture a value at a specific time step and provide this value throughout a property's life span. The scheduling of storage registers for these variables has been optimized. The last improvement merges equivalent assignments to output or state variables (commitments). The merging avoids not only the generation of redundant hardware resources but also simplifies the output multiplexer of the model. Finally, a case study is presented that involves an industrial design of a framer component. The design properties describe the processing of a complete data frame of 19440 cycles length. High-level synthesis and subsequent logic synthesis have been successful and show that the design methodology and synthesis algorithms result in a design with resource usage similar to the industrial component.","","978-1-4577-0634-9","978-1-4577-0632-5","10.1109/ESLsyn.2011.5952292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952292","","","logic design;memory architecture;processor scheduling","deterministic control automaton;hardware models;logic design methodology;logic synthesis;optimized power set construction algorithm;redundant hardware resources;storage register scheduling;very long operation properties","","","","0","","18","","","20110714","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A model-based inter-process resource sharing approach for high-level synthesis of dataflow graphs","Zebelein, C.; Falk, J.; Haubelt, C.; Teich, J.","Univ. of Rostock, Rostock, Germany","Electronic System Level Synthesis Conference (ESLsyn), 2012","2-3 June 2012","2012","","","17","22","High-level synthesis tools are gaining more and more acceptance in industrial design flows. While they increase productivity in implementing a single complex hardware module, synthesizing and optimizing many hardware components simultaneously is still an open problem. In particular, resource sharing is typically only performed for single components, thereby neglecting optimization possibilities across concurrent modules. On the other hand, domain-specific models and specifications, which are generally seen as a key ingredient to raise the level of abstraction in future design flows, may enable such global optimizations. In this paper, we present a model-based approach for inter-process resource sharing which provides for efficient high-level synthesis of streaming applications modeled as a set of communicating processes. The applicability of the proposed approach is validated by a case study.","2117-4628","978-1-4673-1630-9","978-2-9539987-7-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240591","","Computational modeling;Delay;Multiplexing;Optimization;Pipelines;Registers;Resource management","data flow graphs;high level synthesis;optimisation;system-on-chip","MPSoC synthesis;concurrent module;dataflow graphs;domain-specific model;domain-specific specification;global optimizations;hardware component optimization;hardware component synthesis;high-level synthesis tool;industrial design flow;model-based interprocess resource sharing approach;single-complex hardware module;streaming applications","","","","0","","13","","","20120716","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
